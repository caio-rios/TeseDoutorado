Abstract = {Muslim communities in the UK in recent years. It takes a variety of
   forms, from formal political organization and activism, to volunteering,
   civic entrepreneurialism and the assertion of politics through personal
   acts and behaviour. Some of this political activism has been met with
   fear and trepidation as observers worry it is a sign of subversive
   behaviour or a desire for separatism. However, in most cases this
   mobilization is a welcome development, not just because it enhances the
   democratic health of the nation, but because it is a necessary component
   of attempts to counter the threat from violent extremism. As the
   introduction to this special issue outlines, democracy should render
   violence unnecessary because it allows all groups and individuals to
   express their views and interests through a process of rational
   deliberation. This article explores this point through the lens of the
   experience of British Muslims and argues that heightened political
   activism is a positive sign and can, ultimately, contribute to the
   elimination of terrorism.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {1065-1084},
Abstract = {This opening section briefly introduces international political party
   support, that is, assistance to political parties by international
   organizations, mostly from the US and Europe, to strengthen individual
   political parties, to promote peaceful interaction between parties and
   to help to create a more stable and democratic environment for political
   parties in new, struggling or flawed democracies. Before going on to
   introduce the contributions to this collection, this introduction
   discusses three major issues related to international support to
   political parties: the current `party crisis' in young as well as in old
   democracies; the intrusive (political) nature of international party
   assistance; and the difficulties involved in assessing its
   effectiveness. Political parties seem much more difficult to work with
   than (other) political and civil society organizations. Subsequently, we
   will turn to the case studies, which focus on the former Soviet Union,
   the Balkans, and Africa, with excursions into Cambodia and El Salvador.
   Most of the contributions dwell on two contrasting country cases, and
   all of them combine attention to the state of political parties and
   party systems in their respective countries with the role played by
   international involvement and party support in particular. We will
   briefly present and discuss the major issues raised for international
   party support in the country studies, and try to formulate an answer to
   the question about where and when party support might make a meaningful
   contribution to supporting democratic transformation and consolidation.},

Abstract = {Much of the quantitative literature on civil wars and ethnic conflict
   ignores the role of the state or treats it as a mere arena for political
   competition among ethnic groups. Other studies analyze how the state
   grants or withholds minority rights and faces ethnic protest and
   rebellion accordingly, while largely overlooking the ethnic power
   configurations at the state's center. Drawing on a new data set oil
   Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) that identifies all politically relevant
   ethnic groups and their access to central state power around the world
   from 1946 through 2005, the authors analyze outbreaks of armed conflict
   as the result of competing ethnonationalist claims to state power. The
   findings indicate that representatives of ethnic groups are more likely
   to initiate conflict with the government (1) the more excluded from
   state power they are, especially if they have recently lost power, (2)
   the higher their mobilizational capacity, and (3) the more they have
   experienced conflict in the past.},

Abstract = {This analysis fills an important lacuna in comparative legislative
   studies by testing the veto players theory against a newly constructed
   data set of significant domestic policy legislation passed in the
   Republic of Ireland between 1949 and 2000. Distinguishing between
   single-party majority, coalition, and minority governments, the analysis
   places into sharp relief the ways in which the unique context of Irish
   political parties and institutional dynamics conflict with the basic
   tenets of the veto players framework. The results underscore the
   contextual constraints on applicability of the theory.},

Title = {Beyond the fallacy of coup-ism: conceptualizing civilian control of the
   military in emerging democracies},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {950-975},
Abstract = {It is consensus in the democratization literature that civilian control
   of the military is a necessary ingredient for democracy and democratic
   consolidation. However, there is considerable disagreement on what
   civilian control of the military exactly entails and there is a lack of
   solid theoretical arguments for how weak or absent civilian control
   affects democratic governance. Furthermore, a considerable portion of
   the research literature is captured by the fallacy of coup-ism, ignoring
   the many other forms in which military officers can constrain the
   authority of democratically elected political leaders to make political
   decisions and get them implemented. This article addresses these lacunae
   by providing a new conceptual framework for the analysis of
   civil-military relations in emerging democracies. From democracy theory
   it derives a definition of civilian control as a certain distribution of
   decision-making power between civilian leaders and military officers.
   Based on this definition, the authors develop a five-dimensional concept
   of civilian control, discuss the effects of weakly institutionalized
   civilian control on the quality of democracy and address the chances for
   democratic consolidation.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {899-919},
Abstract = {Since gaining independence from Indonesia in 1999, Timor-Leste has been
   pursuing an agenda of democratization. However, in the villages of
   Timor-Leste traditional ideas of socio-political legitimacy continue to
   be strong. The purpose of this article is to examine how the new
   democratic ideals are being incorporated into local politics, where
   traditional law, or lisan, continues to guide the daily lives of the
   villagers. This article argues that democratization in this context
   should not be seen as integrating one `type' of governance (liberal
   democracy) into a social structure that is informed by another `type' of
   governance that is qualitatively different and in opposition to the
   first. Rather, evidence shows that communities are engaging within both
   spheres of governance simultaneously, as part of the everyday politics
   of village life. This article critically examines the areas where
   traditional and democratic institutional spheres come together,
   resulting in structured systems of mutual recognition, as well as the
   areas where the spheres have been in conflict. The author concludes that
   the fundamental areas of tension that have emerged between the spheres
   tend to be where notions of `respect-in-community' as the basis for
   human security are threatened.},

Abstract = {This article provides an overview of existing obligations for democratic
   elections in public international law (PIL), and links these obligations
   to criteria for assessing electoral processes. We argue that PIL
   provides a basis for election observation that is more transparent, more
   objective, and has greater authority with host countries because it
   relies on states' acknowledged international legal commitments. In
   addition, the authors argue that this approach provides a solid
   foundation for building broad consensus on what constitutes
   `international standards for democratic elections', an often-used term
   for which there still is no single commonly accepted definition.},

Abstract = {This study argues that individual parties and party competition in El
   Salvador and Cambodia today are still profoundly affected by the period
   of civil war that has long passed. The war-time origins of the main
   Salvadoran and Cambodian parties have left a deep imprint on their
   organizational structures and style of leadership, just as war-time
   political exclusion set the tone for unbalanced party competition after
   the war. Although El Salvador's party system is more institutionalized
   and pluralistic than Cambodia's, there have been clear cross-national
   patterns of unequal institutionalization and ruling party dominance that
   are a product of the war. International engagement ranging from election
   observation, election organization to party assistance has had some
   benefits, particularly for opposition parties. At the party system
   level, however, international support has only been of minor influence,
   with the possible exception of financial, economic and technical
   assistance to the government, which has served to accentuate the
   tendency towards dominance by the party in power.},

   methodologies in an effort to expand on the work done by previous
   scholars. Conclusions of the empirical analysis point to the finding
   that political conditionality is most effective when close cooperation
   exists between donors. This coordination, however, is frequently
   sabotaged by self-interested donor-patrons, illustrated by the case of
   Cameroon and France. This pattern is generalizable and significantly
   undermines the overall success rate of a political conditionality
   approach.},

Abstract = {Generally speaking the effects of international political party
   assistance are viewed negatively or at least controversially. This study
   attributes some of the shortcomings of political party aid to the poor
   relationship between assistance providers and political science party
   research. They simply operate in different worlds. Party assistance
   lacks clear-cut concepts and strategies in practice, which makes it
   difficult to evaluate it adequately. At issue is its `standard method',
   with its `transformative' intention to change the party organization of
   the assistance receivers. At the same time, the scholarship on political
   parties can provide only limited help to assistance providers due to its
   own conceptual and methodological restrictions, such as the Western
   European bias of its major concepts, the predominance of a functionalist
   approach, and the scant empirical research on political parties outside
   Europe and the US. Taking a cue from recent political party research, we
   could begin to question the overarching role of political parties in the
   transition and consolidation process of new democracies. Other research
   findings emphasize the co-existence of different types of party
   organizations, and the possibility of different organizational
   developments, which might all be consistent with consolidating
   democracy. All this suggests abandoning the controversial transformative
   aim of political party aid.},

Abstract = {At the end of July 2009, South African cities became the terrain of
   violent protests. Several reasons lay behind the social unrest, but
   protesters were particularly vocal in demanding basic services and
   houses, reminding the newly elected president of his electoral promises
   of delivering to the poor. This article analyses two of the most
   prominent post-apartheid social movements that in the past decade have
   been confronting the state on issues of services and accountability.
   These struggles reveal the limits of the unfinished democratization and
   the dysfunction that characterizes policy and decision-making processes
   at the local level. These movements are contributing through their
   existence and actions to the deepening of democracy by creating new
   spaces for political confrontation and participation that can influence
   local governance and enhance development.},

Title = {Ties that bind? The rise and decline of ethno-regional partisanship in
   Malawi, 1994-2009},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Abstract = {In the first three elections following Malawi's return to democracy in
   1993, voting patterns displayed a clear ethno-regional pattern. Then in
   2009 the regional pattern broke down in dramatic fashion, with the
   incumbent President, Bingu wa Mutharika, attracting majority support
   across all three regions. This article first examines whether ethnic
   identities were at the root of Malawi's ethno-regional electoral
   pattern. Our tests show that while ethnic identities were associated
   with partisan attachments in some areas, regional patterns were more
   consistently related to other factors, particularly views of the
   government's performance and the inclusiveness of the ruling party. We
   then examine the breakdown of the regional pattern, drawing on trend
   analysis of public opinion data from 1999 to 2008. We show that by 2009
   the majority of Malawians in all three regions had come to hold positive
   views of Mutharika's performance and had come to see his government as
   inclusive. We conclude, therefore, that shifts in patterns of
   partisanship had more to do with political factors-Mutharika's symbolic
   and substantive policies during this first term-than ethnic identities.
   Malawi reminds us that incumbents, when faced with incentives to
   construct multi-ethnic support bases, can use the power of the state to
   reach out across ethnic political boundaries and re-order supposedly
   entrenched patterns of partisanship.},

   Freedom House case},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {68-97},
Abstract = {While several studies have dealt with methodological aspects of
   measuring democracy, little attention has been devoted to the political
   and ideological issues that affect the construction and structure of
   these measuring instruments. The aim of this study is twofold: in
   analysing the cultural and economic dimensions of the Freedom House (FH)
   organization, it seeks to delineate the political background of FH, thus
   underlining its neoconservative bias. Secondly, by focusing on the
   changes over time in the checklists used by FH to measure democracy,
   this study aims to analyse to what extent these changes are
   ideologically driven, in particular, to what are they linked to the
   neoliberal paradigm. Indeed, the hypothesis is that the construction of
   FH's scales has been affected by the neoliberal climate in which they
   were conceived. In the first part, the work reconstructs the academic
   debate about FH's scales and the historical and political context which
   brought to the affirmation of neoliberal democracy. It also provides a
   discussion regarding the importance of measurement as a political tool.
   In the second part, the study provides an analysis of FH through the
   reconstruction of its political-ideological profile, beginning with the
   formation of FH to its current internal culture. The third part provides
   an analysis of the checklists used by FH for measuring democracy. Our
   findings show that because of the changes in methodology and the strict
   interconnection between methodological and political aspects, FH data do
   not offer an unbroken and politically neutral time series, such that
   their use for cross-time analyses both for research and policy is
   questionable.},

Abstract = {In parliamentary democracies, the transfer of power from one government
   to the next is sometimes characterized by long periods of negotiations
   in which party leaders bargain over the composition and policy
   objectives of a new cabinet. Although these delays can have substantial
   political and economic consequences, surprisingly little is known about
   their determinants. Moreover, the few studies that exist reach
   contradictory conclusions. In this article, the author examines how
   factors relating to uncertainty and bargaining complexity influence the
   duration of the government formation process in 16 West European
   countries from 1944 to 1998. In line with the article's theoretical
   expectations, the author finds that factors increasing uncertainty over
   the type of cabinet that is acceptable always lead to delays in forming
   governments but that factors increasing bargaining complexity, such as
   the number of parties and ideological polarization in the legislature,
   only do so when there is sufficient uncertainty among political actors.
   The present analysis helps to resolve the contradictory findings in the
   literature.},

Abstract = {How does an undemocratic country create democratic institutions and
   transform its polity in such a way that democratic values and practices
   become integral parts of its political culture? This article uses the
   case of Japan to advocate for a new theoretical approach to the study of
   democratization. In particular, it examines how theoretical models based
   on the European and North American experiences have difficulty
   explaining the process of democratization in Japan, and argues that a
   state-in-society approach is better suited to explaining the
   democratization process' diverse cultural contexts. Taking a bottom-up
   view of recent developments in Japanese civil society through the close
   examination of two cases - one traditional organization dating from the
   pre-war era (neighbourhood associations) and one new-style group formed
   in 2000 (Association of New Elder Citizens) - this article illustrates
   how Japanese citizens have democratized their political culture at the
   grassroots. The state-in-society approach to democratization is
   particularly useful for the study of democratization processes in
   non-Western countries where the development of democracy requires not
   only the modification of a traditional political culture but also the
   development of new, indigenous, democratic ideas and practices.},

Abstract = {The article is interested in the main reasons for the emergence and
   enforcement of party bans in sub-Saharan Africa. While the introduction
   of legal provisions that allow for the banning of particularistic
   political parties is the standard on the African continent, few
   countries actually use these provisions and actually deny registration
   or ban existing parties. We use qualitative comparative analysis to
   compare the introduction of party bans and the patterns of
   implementation across all sub-Saharan countries. Our analysis shows that
   structural conditions do matter. Countries that did not introduce legal
   provisions to ban political parties combine a British colonial
   background and a stronger tradition of multi-party democracy. With
   regard to the decision to actually use these provisions our analysis
   shows the interaction of two conditions to be decisive: Countries which
   have experienced ethnically motivated violence in the past and which are
   at the same time `liberalizing' their regimes rely on party bans to
   restrict political party competition.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {769-786},
Abstract = {Senegal has a long history of multiparty rule. In the 1970s the regime
   used party regulation to restrict political competition; since the 1990s
   and notwithstanding a steady rise of the number of political parties to
   around 150 at the end of 2008, there have been only a few attempts to
   regulate the activities of political parties. Party bans have been
   effective in limiting the politicization of ethnicity in the party
   system, but other social and political variables have contributed
   equally to this outcome. Formal rules have not been applied in stopping
   the rise of religious parties, as the electoral success of these parties
   remains limited. The shrinking importance of political parties in the
   increasingly personalist regime of President Wade makes regulation of
   party activities a less contested issue.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Pages = {98-124},
Abstract = {US democracy promotion is integral to the pursuit of the grand project
   of the American Mission. By promoting democracy America makes its role
   one of international engagement as opposed to one of isolation. The
   first part of this paper examines the political and cultural aspects of
   US democracy promotion in the post-Cold War era through the bi-polar
   framework of the case-specific versus one-size-fits-all. To better
   understand USAID's democracy promotion policy, the second part takes
   this framework and applies it to its political reform strategy in Bosnia
   under the Clinton administration from 1995 to 2000 and Afghanistan under
   the Bush administration from 2001 to 2008. This paper confirms that
   America's democracy promotion simultaneously employed both the
   case-specific and one-size-fits-all approaches. USAID programmes and
   projects did at times respond to local conditions but nevertheless
   appear to employ a blueprint design.},

Abstract = {Party assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina has focused on encouraging
   multi-ethnic and moderate mono-ethnic parties by placing funding and
   political restrictions on ethnonationalist parties while providing
   technical assistance and public support to those parties with less
   nationalist agendas. However, multi-ethnic parties have met with very
   limited electoral success and moderate mono-ethnic parties have found
   electoral success primarily by radicalizing their political discourse to
   match that of nationalist parties. This study provides evidence for the
   effect of international intervention drawn from patterns of electoral
   support for multi-ethnic and moderate mono-ethnic parties in canton,
   entity and national elections from the 2006 general elections in Bosnia
   and Herzegovina. The analysis shows that even voters who are predisposed
   to vote for multi-ethnic parties are much less likely to choose
   non-nationalist parties in elections where parties representing other
   ethnicities also compete. As a result, there is a clear trade-off
   between promoting Bosnia's integration and promoting parties and
   candidates who refrain from using often incendiary nationalist rhetoric.},

Title = {Informal politics and the uncertain context of transition: revisiting
   early stage non-democratic development in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-25},
Abstract = {This article examines the genesis and influence of informal politics on
   non-democratic outcomes in Central Asia. As opposed to current
   scholarship which explains the emergence of informal politics as a
   result of kinship-based cultural legacies, this work uses the broader
   analytical framework of neopatrimonialism to understand informal
   political phenomena while emphasizing the role of uncertainty and
   contingent actor choice in explaining its appearance. The article also
   assesses how informal political behaviour (patronage and patron-client
   relations) was used to consolidate authoritarianism. Using Kazakhstan's
   (1990-95) early transition period as a case study this article notes how
   three processes central to transition (institutional conflict, emerging
   pluralism, and electoral competition) elicited a degree of uncertainty
   which destabilized prior institutional equilibrium. The president of
   Kazakhstan applied informal forms of politics to manage this uncertainty
   to re-assert his power and consolidate his personal authoritarian rule
   at the expense of emerging democratic institutions. The article
   illustrates how the uncertain and contingent process of transition is
   instrumental to the emergence of informal politics and the durability of
   authoritarianism in Kazakhstan, and that informal political relations
   and behaviour are important to understanding non-democratic and
   democratic paths in former Soviet states.},

Abstract = {Post-civil war democratization is a critical element of building
   sustainable peace in post-civil war states. Yet studies of democratic
   transition and survival suggest that the post-civil war environment is
   not hospitable to either the transition toward or the survival of
   democracy. This inhospitality may be due to the fact that post-civil war
   environments are contentious. After a civil war, the former protagonists
   fear for their security and also want to protect their political and
   economic interests. The central argument of this study is that former
   rivals can agree to a transition toward democracy to the extent that a
   stable balance of power exists between the government and rebel groups;
   a balance that eliminates the sort of security dilemma that would
   encourage one or both parties to resume armed conflict. Such a balance
   should ensure access to political power and economic resources. This
   study identifies factors that contribute to the establishment of a
   balance of power between former protagonists and factors that affect its
   stability. The presence of these factors should affect the decision of
   former protagonists on whether or not they can achieve their political
   and economic interests if they agree to a transition toward democracy
   once the civil war ends. Based on this theoretical argument, I have
   derived empirically testable hypotheses. In the survival analysis
   performed, I find support for the theoretical arguments. The findings of
   this study have some policy implications.},

Abstract = {With the decision to abstain from introducing a constitutional provision
   for the banning of particularistic and extremist parties South Africa
   appears to be the exception in Africa. This article is interested in the
   main reasons for this particular constitutional practice. For this
   purpose three hypotheses will be developed. The article argues that the
   structures of South Africa's transition to democracy, in particular the
   beliefs, experiences, and interests of the main transition actors,
   account for this specific constitutional choice.},

Abstract = {The effects of party system features and election rules on ideological
   representation can be seen in parliamentary elections in Western
   democracies over a fifty-year period. ``Distortion{''} is short-term
   representation failure-the distance between the median voter and the
   legislature or government immediately after the election. Electoral
   choice and left-right positions of parties (from the manifesto data) can
   be used to estimate median voter positions. The number of parties, party
   polarization, and the election rules all independently affect
   ideological distances. But party system polarization seems to be the
   predominate factor shaping distortion of governments' relationship with
   the median voter. Examining the effects of party systems under different
   election rules helps clarify the causal connections between legislative
   and government levels.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Pages = {326-349},
Abstract = {This article is concerned with state-sponsored electoral violence in
   liberalized autocracies. The first section of the paper identifies a
   number of variables that can help explain the decision calculus of
   authoritarian incumbents to deploy force against strong electoral
   challengers. The second section then examines these propositions with
   reference to Egypt and Morocco. Drawing on recent parliamentary
   elections in both countries the article questions why, despite facing
   the challenge of political Islam, the two regimes differed so markedly
   in their willingness to manipulate the polls by recourse to violence.
   Whilst the Egyptian authorities decided to abrogate all pretence of
   peaceful elections in favour of violent repression against the Muslim
   Brotherhood candidates and sympathizers, no such tactics were deployed
   by the ruling elite in Morocco. We suggest that three principal factors
   influenced the regimes' response to this electoral challenge:(1) the
   centrality of the elected institution to authoritarian survival; (2) the
   availability of alternative electioneering tools; and (3) the
   anticipated response of the international community. The article
   concludes by suggesting that in order to understand better when and how
   states deploy violence in elections, we need to focus on a more complex
   set of factors rather than simply on the electoral potency of key
   opposition challengers or the authoritarian nature of the state.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Abstract = {Regional multilateral regimes have become important instruments for
   promoting and defending democracy around the world. The novel nature of
   these regional instruments has generated a cottage industry in social
   science scholarship. Yet, none of these works compare the democracy
   promotion and defence regimes of the Organization of American States
   (OAS) and the African Union (AU). This article is designed to fill this
   gap. We argue that the unique constellation of actors that are members
   of each respective organization have reinforced two distinct democracy
   promotion and defence paths. The state-driven regime evolution
   characteristic of the Americas contrasts with Africa's expert-driven
   process of regime construction. The state-centric process of the OAS
   regime has bolstered a narrow interstate multilateralism that upholds
   traditional sovereign state prerogatives and minimizes the role for
   non-state actors in the promotion and defence of democracy in the
   Americas. The expert-driven process of AU's regime construction has
   fostered a legalistic approach to democratic promotion and defence in
   Africa and opened up space for non-state actors to play a central role
   in the development of regional democracy promotion and defence norms.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the issue of the challenges of democracy building
   and the role of civil society in this process by focusing on three
   countries in southeastern Europe, Albania, Bulgaria, and the Former
   Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Since the 1990s, when these three
   post-communist states under took the democratization process, formidable
   challenges and obstacles to the democratization process have been
   encountered by all three states which facilitates a comparative
   analysis, while differences remain as well, especially since Bulgaria
   became a member of the European Unionin 2007. The development of an
   indigenous civil society is perceived as both a necessary prerequisite
   for a qualitative democracy to develop and be maintained in these
   societies, and as a project under construction that needs to be
   culturally contextualized to be relevant to the population it purports
   to serve.},

Abstract = {With the re-introduction of multiparty politics at the beginning of the
   1990s most African countries started to regulate political parties
   extensively, especially ethnic and other particularistic parties. This
   article presents a new database on particularistic and other party bans
   in sub-Saharan Africa, drawing on a comprehensive collection of African
   party regulations and records of their implementation since 1990. After
   demonstrating the magnitude and complexity of party bans in Africa the
   article deals in depth with enforcement institutions and legal
   procedures. It shows that party bans are especially pervasive in less
   democratic countries and have often targeted politically relevant
   parties.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {666-686},
Abstract = {Following the introduction of multiparty systems, almost all sub-Saharan
   countries have introduced wide-ranging measures of party regulation,
   particularly bans on ethnic or - in more general terms - particularistic
   parties, in order, it is claimed, to prevent intercommunal conflict and
   to promote democracy. While this restrictive type of party regulation
   has become a dominant political feature in Africa, little is known about
   the efficacy of such measures. This article engages in an analysis of
   the possible effects on democracy and peace of different types of party
   regulation and implemented party bans and shows that party bans are
   apparently less suited to alleviating conflict than has been claimed. It
   also finds that implemented bans seem to be negatively related to
   democracy as ethnic bans are frequently abused to suppress the political
   opposition or to silence ethnic or religious minorities.},

Abstract = {Since 1990 the banning of ethnic and other identity-based parties has
   become the norm in sub-Saharan Africa. This article focuses on three
   East-African countries - Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda - which opted for
   different ways of dealing with such parties. The analysis shows that the
   laws have actually been enforced by the responsible regulatory
   institutions. However, they have only marginally influenced the
   character of the political parties in the three countries: a comparison
   of regional voting patterns suggests that bans on particularistic
   parties have not ensured the emergence of aggregative parties with a
   national following in Tanzania and Uganda. In Kenya on the other hand,
   where such a ban has been absent until 2008, parties proved not to be
   more regionally based. In all three countries governing parties were
   clearly more nationalized than opposition parties, while the overall
   level of party nationalization is lower than in other world regions.},

Abstract = {This study examines the impact of international administrations on the
   development and functioning of political parties in post-conflict
   settings, using Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo as case studies. These
   cases show how, next to the establishment of a functioning institutional
   framework, the development and maturity of local political elites are
   crucial factors of post-conflict democratization, as a genuine handover
   of power has yet to take place in both countries. Notwithstanding the
   international political relevance attached to the establishment of
   democratic governance in post-conflict areas, the local dimension of
   (enforced) democratization, especially the role and relevance of
   political parties, has been largely overlooked in academic research.
   This analysis therefore explores the institutional and cultural
   dimensions of `external' democratization and international
   administrations' influence on political parties andpolitics in
   Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.},

   justification},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {709-729},
Abstract = {This article discusses the public justifications brought forward for
   three waves of bans on political parties in Rwanda after the regime
   change of 1994. While the standard narrative of protecting democracy
   from its enemies ('militant democracy') was not invoked, two alternative
   narratives carried the burden of justification. The first is that of
   banning strongly particularistic parties, i.e. parties that discriminate
   or incite hatred and violence along ethnic or similar lines. The second
   is that of banning the former ruling party, responsible for mass
   atrocities, and its successor organizations. While both justification
   narratives have strong initial plausibility against Rwanda's history of
   ethnic conflict and genocide, and mirror analogous justifications for
   banning parties elsewhere, a detailed discussion of the evidence
   suggests that Rwanda's bans mainly served the purpose of repressing
   political opposition. The justifications brought forward in the later
   waves of bans remain unconvincing and cannot claim political legitimacy.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Number = {1},
Pages = {125-142},
Abstract = {The article deals with the different approaches followed by the Turkish
   Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in
   party prohibition cases. The Turkish Constitution and even more so the
   Law on Political Parties contain a long list of party bans, the
   violation of which leads to the closure of the party by the
   Constitutional Court. The Turkish Constitutional Court, both under the
   1961 and the 1982 Constitutions, interpreted these provisions in an
   exceedingly illiberal manner, and has so far closed down a total of 24
   political parties. Turkish rules and practices concerning the
   prohibition of political parties are among the most important `democracy
   deficits' of the Turkish political system. In the article, the Turkish
   Court's illiberal approach to party prohibition cases, especially those
   involving the protection of the national and territorial integrity of
   the state and of the principle of secularism, is compared with the much
   more liberal criteria developed by the ECtHR and the Venice Commission.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Britain's `Contest' counter-terrorism strategy with its `4 Ps'
   codification is often held up as a paradigm of an effective liberal
   democratic counter-terror strategy. However, while the strategy has had
   some success and been widely emulated internationally, questions remain
   about the `generational' aspect frequently referred to by government and
   what kind of an impact such a wide-ranging approach might be having in
   the long-term upon the United Kingdom. This article seeks to explore the
   `why' and `how' of the British counter-terrorism strategy while probing
   some of the areas which may offer themselves as problematic in the
   longer term. In particular the author explores the `Prevent' part of the
   strategy which seeks to prevent radicalization leading to terrorism from
   ever taking place, asking questions about how defined the strategy
   appears to be and how much the UK might in fact be setting itself up to
   counter a war without end.},

Title = {Perverse state formation and securitized democracy in Latin America},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {286-306},
Abstract = {Two key themes of this special issue are: how violence challenges
   democracy and how democratic politics might, over time, diminish
   violence. This paper explores how violence(s) embedded in Latin
   America's state formation process are multiplied rather than diminished
   through democratization, generating a securitizing logic which
   fundamentally distorts democratic principles. Known for its high levels
   of historic violence(s), Latin America today is second only to Southern
   Africa in levels of homicide in the world. Some see contemporary
   violence in the region as a rupture from the past: `new violence'
   characterized by its urban and social nature in contrast to the rural
   and political nature of the past. Violence, however, has a reproductive
   quality, by which it is transmitted through space as well as time. This
   article argues that rather than reflecting a rupture with the past,
   violence in Latin America has merely accelerated its complex
   reproduction in many forms across (gendered) spaces of socialization.
   The paradox is that the proliferation of this violence has occurred
   alongside democratic transitions. Although the state is not directly
   responsible for all the violence which is taking place, this article
   argues that in many countries it is the very trajectory of the
   state-formation process which has facilitated this rapid reproduction of
   violence. I call this process `perverse'. Democracy is increasingly
   subject to the fears and insecurities of the population, enabling the
   state to build its authority not on the protection of citizens' rights,
   but on its armed encounters and insidious collusions with violent actors
   in the name of `security provision'. Categories of people become
   non-citizens, subjected to abuse by state, para-state and non-state
   violent actors. If this process continues, democracy will ultimately be
   securitized.},

Abstract = {International migrants are agents of democratic diffusion. They spread
   attitudes and behaviors absorbed in democratic host countries to their
   less democratic home countries by way of three processes: (a) migrant
   returns, (b) cross-border communication between migrants still abroad
   and their friends and family back home, and (c) migrant information
   networks in high-volume migration-producing communities. Marshaling data
   from an original June 2006 national survey in Mexico, the authors show
   that through one or another of these processes, migration alters the
   political participation and behavior of Mexicans living in Mexico.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1024-1049},
Abstract = {This article investigates the impact of international efforts to
   cultivate effective and authoritative local governing institutions in
   the Western Balkans, a prime testing ground for democratization aid to
   post-war states. It explores three hypotheses, each of which argues that
   a particular approach of international actors toward domestic officials
   best improves the quality of local governance. The study's gathering of
   interview and survey data from field-based actors enables it to evaluate
   local government reforms' impact on domestic communities. This
   investigation arrives at three findings. First, in the view of Western
   Balkan peoples, local governance reforms do not produce benefits when
   they are either imposed or ignored by international authorities.
   Secondly, reforms produce benefits for local communities when they are
   designed to meet domestic concerns. More specifically, reforms valued by
   local communities are designed in ways that respond to domestic, rather
   than international, concepts of good local governance that emphasize
   socioeconomic aspects and produce tangible benefits. Well designed
   reforms also include significant aid targeting local governance that is
   coupled with the promise of a larger political settlement that is
   attractive to powerful domestic elites and contingent on clearly
   articulated local governance reforms. Thirdly, such aid best
   characterises European Union efforts only in Macedonia.},

Abstract = {What accounts for the ``colored revolutions{''} of the former Soviet
   Union? Analysis of postcommunist political economies reveals that states
   that underwent reform saw the emergence of a new capitalist class whose
   interests sometimes put them at odds with the regime. Following
   fraudulent elections, business elites played an active role in financing
   mobilization and signaling mass discontent, which undermined regime
   support and hastened regime change. Countries that did not privatize
   failed to develop an independent capitalist class and therefore faced
   smaller and weaker oppositions. This argument is demonstrated by
   analyzing mass protests that toppled regimes in Georgia, Ukraine, and
   Kyrgyzstan, and by the negative cases of Azerbaijan, Belarus, and
   Kazakhstan. It has implications for the study of hybrid regimes, social
   movements, and postcommunist political development.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Abstract = {Democracy assistance programmes have gradually included support for
   political parties in addition to support for civil society, parliaments
   and the electoral process. But, does international party assistance
   contribute to party and party system institutionalization? This analysis
   addresses the issue of impact of external support for political parties
   using the case of one donor, the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty
   Democracy (NIMD) and the impact of its activities in Malawi and in
   Zambia. NIMD's stated objectives are to promote party system
   institutionalization as well as the institutionalization of individual
   parties. Its funds are spent to support parties in three ways:
   strengthening inter-party dialogue, strengthening party organizations,
   and improving party-civil society linkages. This contribution assesses
   what NIMD hoped to achieve with their party support programmes and how
   recipient party representatives in Zambia and Malawi evaluate the
   support provided by NIMD. The analysis suggests that there are
   significant challenges for international party support. While the
   political parties indicate a priority for bilateral support, NIMD views
   such bilateral support as less effective for their overall ambitions.
   The discussion shows furthermore that enhancement of civil society-party
   relations through external funding modalities may be particularly
   challenging.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {235-250},
Abstract = {This article is concerned with the relationship between democracy and
   violence. The first section argues that the way in which that
   relationship is characterized depends on how violence is defined. Some
   definitions extend the ordinary understanding of violence as an act of
   direct physical coercion. Variously, they draw attention to indirect
   forms of violence that are the result of failures to act by governments,
   and to institutional and structural violence embedded in the normal
   functioning of `peace-loving' democracies. This, together with liberal
   democrats' occasional readiness to resort to violence of a direct and
   physical kind, counters the idea that violence is inherently anathema to
   democracy. In this view violence and democracy may go hand in hand. The
   second section explores one way in which democracy and violence do seem
   to be mutually exclusive. When democracy appears to be threatened by
   violence and that threat is portrayed as exceptional, democratic
   governments may show an alarming readiness to resort to violence and to
   jettison democratic principles and values in proportion to the perceived
   threat.},

Abstract = {Despite myriad explanations for government spending levels, few studies
   have included considerations of party system institutionalization. This
   is surprising since the level of party system institutionalization
   should significantly affect policymaking. Weakly institutionalized
   systems, that are characterized by loose ties with societal groups,
   higher volatility levels, and poorly developed internal organizations,
   should result in lower public goods but higher parochial goods spending.
   In contrast, more institutionalized systems should result in more public
   goods spending as these systems try to appeal to broader swaths of the
   population. Time-series cross-sectional analyses, with three different
   spending measures as dependent variables, show that institutionalized
   party systems significantly influence spending patterns.},

Abstract = {There is no model of politics without violence and no violence without a
   vision of the political, democratic and non-democratic. This article
   investigates how this claim applies to the case studies of Hamas and
   Hizbullah. More specifically, it looks at the archaeology of violence
   practised by both organizations in the name of Islamic resistance
   (muqawamah), examining its moral and politico-religious foundation and
   lineage as well as demotic impulses. Islamic resistance, I argue, not
   only sabotages the Weberian template of single monopoly, legitimacy and
   centre in the dispensation of violence, but also deploys it from the
   margins as part of a Godly-sanctioned ethical quest for notions of
   sacrifice, worship, emancipation, transnational solidarity, and civic
   community. It reveals a politics of knowledge-making, and power founded
   on a heterodoxy that interrogates Western systemic political orthodoxy
   and its attendant formal constructs and dogmas of violence and,
   indirectly, of organized politics. The discussion is prefaced by a
   critical assessment of this claim within Western democracies.},

Volume = {17},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {217-234},
Abstract = {This article sets out a number of central questions which should be kept
   in mind in any discussion of the relationship of democracy and violence.
   Democracy aims at the exclusion of violence, and theoretically should
   render violence unnecessary, since all groups and individuals should be
   able to express their views and interests through a process of rational
   deliberation. Yet this is obviously not always the case. The democratic
   state, like any other, uses violence when necessary to maintain itself
   in existence and to resist those violent movements that reject
   democratic processes. The danger is that such use of violence may escape
   democratic control and undermine foundational rights which are
   supposedly being defended. Some contemporary democracies are challenged
   by violent movements, but these are in many cases expressions of a
   demand for recognition and inclusion. The question thus has to be probed
   of how democratic societies should respond to such challenges. It is
   suggested here that institutional reform and a new discourse of politics
   should be important elements of such a response.},

Abstract = {Most empirical studies of corruption rely on data using perceptions of
   corruption as a proxy for actual corruption. While this approach might
   be appropriate for advanced democracies, it is less effective for hybrid
   regimes. In these regimes corruption allegations are often used in
   political battles, raising public perceptions of corruption and thus
   reflecting the degree of political competition rather than actual
   corruption. The data on public perceptions of corruption in Russian
   regions produced by Transparency International and the Information for
   Democracy Foundation (INDEM) shows that higher levels of political
   competition and press freedom along with lower economic development
   appear as the key variables contributing to higher public perceptions of
   corruption in Russian regions.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Pages = {175-205},
Abstract = {This article aims to identify the main causal factors that underlie the
   overall levels of mass support for democracy in Hong Kong in the light
   of two approaches of comparative politics. Using a common questionnaire
   in 2003, 2005, and 2008, analyses of their results reveal a more or less
   stable level of support by Hongkongers for democracy. Viewed from the
   perspective of a mass values approach, post-materialism and respect for
   authority are found to be consistently statistically significant factors
   in explaining the support across the three years. The future prospects
   for Hong Kong will thus in part rest on the future trends of
   post-materialism and respect for authority. Viewed from the perspective
   of a perceived performance approach, both perceived economic and
   political performance are found to have consistently exerted a causal
   effect on mass support for democracy. Thus, any attempt to suppress the
   popular demand for democracy by offering only economic sweeteners will
   not, it is argued, be enough. Also, the democrats' ability to shape the
   public's perception of the performance of democracy is pivotal to
   raising mass support. However, it is shown here that the lack of
   relatively strong support among younger and more educated people in Hong
   Kong casts a pall over the prospects for Hong Kong's democratic
   development. Finally, the theoretical implications of the theory of
   post-materialism and the Asian values debate are discussed.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1108-1131},
Abstract = {This contribution explores one of the most widely discussed examples of
   pro-democracy international intervention: regime change in Serbia. It
   takes the contemporary scholarship on regime change one step further,
   however, examining not only the international effort leading up to
   Milosevic's ouster, but also, and most importantly, that which followed.
   As is explained, despite the widely cited premise that democracy aid to
   political parties does not seek to determine electoral outcomes,
   political party assistance in Serbia has often been designed to do
   precisely that. The study examines how partisan party aid has detracted
   from donors' larger efforts to promote democracy abroad. In so doing, it
   demonstrates that a partisan approach to party aid has the potential not
   only to compromise the legitimacy of democracy's promotion abroad, but
   also to undermine fledgling democratic processes in post-authoritarian
   states. In such circumstances, partisan party assistance may very well
   be less desirable than no party assistance at all.},

Abstract = {Taxation is partly a game of credible commitment. Data for eighteen OECD
   countries show that partisan turnover systematically affects the
   long-run equilibrium mix of taxes and services. When partisan turnover
   is low, more right-wing influence permanently increases corporate tax
   revenue and the corporate share of pre-tax income; more left-wing
   influence, by contrast, permanently increases consumption tax revenue
   and social spending. When turnover is high, even powerful partisans do
   not increase taxes that disproportionately affect their supporters. When
   partisans tax their own supporters, they raise more revenue, even when
   we account for some plausible benefits. The theoretical conjectures are
   consistent with the pattern of partisan behavior within countries, not
   just between them.},

Title = {A BIT IS BETTER THAN A LOT Bilateral Investment Treaties and
   Preferential Trade Agreements},
Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1+},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The landscape of the global economy is dotted with institutions that
   regulate investment and trade. In recent years, the number of bilateral
   investment treaties (BITS) and preferential trade agreements (PTAS), in
   particular, has grown at a torrid pace; practically every country is a
   member of at least one-if not many-of these institutions. For all the
   scholarly attention that these institutions have received, however,
   there is little research tying BITS and PTAS together. This is
   surprising, since both aim to increase commerce by making it more
   predictable. The authors seek to fill this gap in the literature. They
   argue that a BIT between a developed and a developing country should
   make it more likely that this pair of states will subsequently form a
   PTA. That said, the wrinkle in the story is that more is not better in
   this regard; the authors further argue that a developing country that
   has many BITS is less likely to conclude a PTA with a wealthy state. The
   authors test these hypotheses using annual data on pairs of developing
   and developed countries between 1960 and 2004 and find strong evidence
   in support of their argument.},

Abstract = {On the basis of an in-depth study of the Swiss Vocational Education and
   Training (VET) system-an extreme case among collectivist regimes-the
   employers' constellation and the elites of the public education
   administration affect patterns of institutional change. If large firms
   are the dominant actors and collaborate with elites in the public
   education administration, institutional change follows a transformative
   pattern. If small and medium firms are in a strong position and have the
   power to influence public elites according to their interests,
   self-preserving institutional change results. With reference to causal
   mechanism of institutional change in VET systems, developments in the
   international political economy and Europe are important intervening
   factors in patterns of institutional change.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to take stock of the insights offered by the
   fast-growing literature on comparative state formation, which is treated
   here as a neglected offshoot of the ``bringing the state back in{''}
   movement of the 1980s. Unlike previous Eurocentric reviews of this
   literature, this article includes works that range broadly in time and
   geography. The author focuses particularly on two areas of interest to
   political scientists: the causes of bureaucratic centralization and the
   origins of durable democratic/authoritarian institutions. The author
   also shows how the literature has reconceptualized the state in response
   to long-standing criticisms directed at this concept. The concept
   remains useful in political science despite impressions otherwise.},

Title = {Political party assistance in transition: the German `Stiftungen' in
   sub-Saharan Africa},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1225-1249},
Abstract = {Despite the fact that the German Stiftungen (political foundations) were
   the first international institutions to work in the field of political
   party development, their party assistance has been neglected in
   political party research for a long time. Remarkably little is known
   about the approaches, strategies and results of their activities. This
   contribution explores the role of the Stiftungen and their party
   assistance approaches in the various stages of the democratization
   process. It explicitly traces the self-declared ambitions of the German
   Stiftungen, and it explores the extent to which their party assistance
   activities take account of the various stages of the democratic
   transition process and of the level of party institutionalization, or
   simply follow abstract, generalized and preconceived ideas. The study
   develops a `phase model of party assistance' in the transition process
   and examines the party assistance activities in two illustrative cases -
   the Friedrich-Ebert Stiftung (FES) in Kenya and in South Africa - in
   seven dimensions of party institutionalization: (1) level of
   organization, (2) internal party democracy, (3) political programme, (4)
   autonomy, (5) roots in society, (6) coherence, and (7) regional and
   international integration.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},

Pages = {920-949},
Abstract = {For the first time in 51 years of independence, Malaysia's ruling
   coalition Barisan Nasional (National Front, BN) under the weak
   leadership of Abdullah Badawi was denied its customary parliamentary
   two-third majority in the 2008 elections. The three major opposition
   parties, which formed the Pakatan Rakyat (The People's Alliance, PR)
   after the elections, increased the number of opposition-held state
   governments from one to five. The opposition had never held more than
   two state governments at any one time.1 For many practitioners and
   students of Malaysian politics, the 2008 poll means the birth of a long
   overdue `two-party system', where two multi-ethnic coalitions contest
   for power and alternate in running the country. After all, two similar
   attempts to build a Malay-dominated second coalition to rival the ruling
   coalition dominated by the ethno-nationalist United Malays National
   Organisation (UMNO) were made in the 1990 and 1999 elections by former
   UMNO leaders who lost in their party in-fighting. Sadly, the coalitions
   built did not survive even the next elections. We argue that such
   optimism may be misplaced due to a failure to appreciate the `electoral
   one-party state' nature of Malaysia.2 Despite having held 13 national
   elections without failure, and having almost no incidence of in- or
   post-election violence, neither a military coup nor `people's power',
   Malaysia has never been anywhere close to being a `consolidated
   democracy', 52 years after joining what Huntington called the second
   wave of democratization.3 For Linz and Stepan, a consolidated democracy
   requires not only a government with de facto authority to generate
   policy and exclusive de jure power, but also that `this government comes
   to power that is the direct result of a free and popular vote'. In other
   words, democracy has to become `the only game in town'.4.},

Abstract = {In the September 2008 Legislative Council election, Hong Kong's
   democrats managed to retain their veto position in the political reform
   process. Now, the democrats face the dilemma of what to do with
   Beijing's 2007 plan for Hong Kong's democratization. According to the
   plan, the people of Hong Kong could see the direct election of the chief
   executive and the entire legislature in 2017 and 2020, respectively.
   Although the plan is not perfect, Hong Kong's pan-democratic camp may
   need to adopt a negotiated approach, given the current political reality
   and the balance of power between local democrats and Beijing. It is
   suggested here that there is room for negotiation in the latter's reform
   plan. If some moderate democrats are willing to pursue a negotiated
   strategy, Beijing's political reform plan for Hong Kong stands a
   significant chance of being approved. Recent developments in Hong Kong
   indicate that such a prospect could indeed materialize.},

Title = {Civil society, political stability, and state power in Central Asia:
   cooperation and contestation},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {795-825},
Abstract = {This article develops a concept of civil society in Central Asia
   distinct from that which emerged from the East European communist
   societies of the late 1980s. Kazakhstan presents a case study of a civil
   society that conceptually can be located between the vibrant civil
   society of the Baltic democracies and the civil society of the strongly
   repressive environments of Belarus or Uzbekistan. Kazakhstan's
   authoritarian structures and cultural traditions make it difficult to
   develop strong independent civic organizations - cooperation tends to
   mark state-civil society relations more than contestation, which shaped
   much of Eastern Europe's experience. Even in a context of relative
   affluence where civil society organizations are allowed some space to
   engage in critical activities, contestation tends to be minimized. This
   is only partially related to state suppression and cooptation; a
   political culture that views democratic processes as potentially
   destabilizing is also a significant factor. Kazakhstan represents a
   distinct Central Asian model of civil society, comparable to Russia but
   qualitatively different from that found in either Eastern or Western
   Europe, where civil society is less willing to confront the state, more
   cooperative with the authoritarian system, and wary of the potential for
   civic activism to degenerate into instability. Differentiating types of
   civil society is important because a key component of Western democracy
   assistance programmes has been providing assistance to build and
   strengthen civil societies. By refining our understanding of distinct
   civil society patterns in Central Asia, we can enhance our knowledge of
   political processes in this critical region, and we may improve the
   effectiveness of democracy assistance programmes. The study is grounded
   in field research, interviews, civil society workshops, survey research,
   and government documents.},

Abstract = {A growing number of political scientists notice worrying deficiencies of
   new democracies in Georgia and Ukraine. Looking for possible reasons
   they usually focus on internal factors. However, external factors may
   have also played their part. This article draws attention to the US
   foreign policy which, it is argued, did not further democratic
   consolidation goals in post-revolutionary Georgia and Ukraine. The Bush
   administration's policy towards these two countries is described as a
   manifestation of a new version of the Kirkpatrick doctrine which
   instructed US foreign-policy makers to choose the lesser evil of the
   two: unconsolidated, yet pro-American, democracies in the post-Soviet
   space.},
