In federal systems, it can be important or beneficial to coordinate crisis management between the various governments. The extent to which intergovernmental coordination occurred and the form it took (vertical or horizontal) varied across countries and regarding the measures taken. By examining the introduction and the subsequent easing of containment measures and the procurement of medical supplies in Australia, Canada, Germany, and Switzerland, this article identifies the circumstances under which intergovernmental coordination occurs. Surprisingly, the existence of strong intergovernmental councils did not lead to closer intergovernmental coordination. Governments coordinated more intensively when jurisdiction was shared, problem pressure was high, and measures were(re-)distributive in nature. Vertical coordination was more likely when vertical intergovernmental councils existed and powers were shared. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {In the United States, environmental federalism largely relies on a system for policy implementation that allows the federal government to delegate primary program authority (or primacy) to state agencies. Although it is an ingrained feature of several major federal environmental policies, such as the Clean Water Act (CWA), there is little evidence to indicate what impact delegating authorities has on programs. In order to examine this, the authors use a synthetic control technique to determine how actual CWA program outcomes in five states compare to expected outcomes if EPA retained primary authority. Findings indicate that while there were no significant differences in Texas and Oklahoma, state primacy led to improved program outcomes in Florida, but worse outcomes in Maine and South Dakota. Conclusions suggest that primacy has asymmetrical impacts that largely depend on state implementation systems, which carries important implications for environmental federalism.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {Citizenship policies are important tools of inclusion and exclusion in a post-partition context. In most cases, they reflect the unitary and mono-ethnic character of newly established states. Their function in countries and territories where an ethnonational break-up resulted in further ethnically diverse societies is far more complex. Citizenship in multilevel states created through state disintegration is a counterintuitive combination of (1) the legacies of the old citizenship tradition and replications of the old federal structure, and (2) processes of ethnic engineering and designing group-centric citizenship regimes. Legacies of the old structure are framed by the modalities of break-up and initial determination of citizenry (e.g., the absence of zero solution), but strongly mirror elements of the previous multilevel construction of citizenship, including bottom-up derivation, ethno-national determination of membership, voting rights and representation. Discontinuities in citizenship policies reflect wider tensions between nation- and state-building (and destruction), and how these processes have been molded through different international influences. We undertake a case-study of two post-Yugoslav multilevel states, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia/the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, with the intent of drawing broader conclusions on how citizenship policies can keep states together or break them apart. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Traditionally, research has focused on arguments related to nationalism and identities. Later, the strategic agency of political parties has been integrated as they typically play a major role in negotiating constitutional reforms. We investigate two institutionalist factors to explain why political Parliamentarians (MPs) favour decentralization while others oppose it: their parliamentary institutional affiliation and their career pattern (as well as the interaction between both). The importance of these factors is studied based on a large-scale survey among Belgian MPs from all federal and regional parliaments. Our results indicate that MPs' preferences for decentralization significantly differ depending on their institutional affiliation (regional MPs being more decentralist than national MPs). This difference is moderated by MPs' career pattern, but only for national MPs (who are more decentralist when they have a regional career pattern). © 2020 The Author(s).

The article outlines the constitutional and statutory authorities available to President Trump and assesses how he used those powers to address the pandemic. It is argued that early, decisive national coordinative systems for containing and mitigating the virus; testing, tracing, contacting, and isolation protocols; data collection standardization; procurement and distribution of supplies; and planning vaccine eligibility and distribution could have reduced the state and local government disadvantages early in the pandemic, saving lives and boosting the economy. © The Author(s) 2021.},

We find that procedural and reciprocal norms of multilateral collaboration are associated with intergovernmental agreements that combine an overarching multilateral framework to pursue common/pan-state priorities with supplementary bilateral agreements to accommodate more specific goals of different provincial governments. © TheAuthor(s) 2018.},

It shows stability in numerous policy fields as well as an overall marked centralization over time, especially in the fiscal and administrative spheres. The principal instrument of dynamic de/centralization has been the enactment of legislation in fields of shared responsibility, with constitutional change also being important. In the 1950s and 1960s, an incremental centralization occurred as political and administrative elites strongly favored uniform living conditions. In a context of Keynesian interventionism and a broad consensus about social planning, the Great Fiscal Reform of 1969 amplified this centralizing trend. The East-West unification of 1989-1990 increased the economic and fiscal heterogeneity of the L€ander and challenged the cultural norm of uniformity. The resulting federalism reforms of 2006 and 2009 blended decentralizing and centralizing measures. © The Author 2017.

Building off Oates' "decentralization theorem" to include inter-jurisdictional spillovers, we develop a new theory suggesting that the interaction of democratic decentralization (the popular election of sub-national governments) and party centralization (the power of national party leaders over sub-national office-seekers) will produce the best service delivery outcomes. To test this argument empirically, we develop a new dataset of sub-national political institutions. Our analyses, which examine educational and health service delivery in 135 countries across thirty years, provide support for our theoretical expectations. © TheAuthor(s) 2018.},

The proliferation of state proposals to ''nullify'' national laws is one manifestation of this intergovernmental conflict. Nullification legislation has appeared in every state and addressed issues that span the ideological spectrum. This article builds an original dataset of over 1,500 nullification proposals that appeared in state legislatures from 2010 to 2016. It identifies three types of nullification-related legislation, including one that has not previously been recognized in the literature, and finds that very little current nullification-related activity consists of classical efforts to declare a national law null and void. It also assesses the factors associated with the introduction and enactment of nullification legislation. Its analysis reveals that, consistent with the notion of ''partisan federalism,'' Republican legislative control is associated with more nullification-related activity. Such activity is also more likely in more populous states. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of CSF Associates: Publius, Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, despite this dominance, the relationship between presidents and governors was often so divisive that the instability within the party threatened the stability of not only the ruling governments, but also the federation as a whole and undermined its productivity. This article examines this anomaly against the background of scholarship emphasizing the crucial role of federation-wide parties in fostering smooth intergovernmental bargains and in facilitating federal stability. It argues that Nigeria's recent experience provides counterevidence of this theory and discusses the mutually reinforcing contextual factors that might have influenced this development, focusing on the PDP's norms and the country's intergovernmental fiscal structure. © 2019 The Author 2019.

	abstract = {A series of recent reforms in German federalism have created a dynamic development unprecedented in the Federal Republic. They aimed at increasing federal and L€ander governments' autonomy by decentralization and separating powers. Being negotiated in established structures of joint decision-making, significant change could hardly be expected. However, change evolved in a sequential process triggered by particular conditions: decisions of the constitutional court in the first federalism reform, the broader fiscal and economic crisis in the second, and a deadline to renovate the fiscal equalization scheme in the third. After first steps to decentralize powers, subsequent reforms reinforced cooperative federalism, but with an even stronger role of the federal government. Following a comparative-historical institutionalist perspective, the federal dynamics can be explained by the interplay of established institutions, routinized negotiation systems and different events triggering change. In contrast to the gradual evolution of cooperative federalism, these triggers caused unintended and contradictory effects. © The Author 2017.

Additionally, what factors affect those decisions? We examine all governors' executive orders affecting local governments in the first five months of the 2020 pandemic. We find that preemption did occur, especially in the early months of the pandemic. States that gave their localities more autonomy were associated with preemption throughout the pandemic; the governor's party affiliation and her ideological match with local officials were associated with greater preemption in some phases of the pandemic but not others.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

This article examines the prominent role of state governments in defining the scope of equal rights protections for the nation's transgender community. Some states have expanded transgender rights, whereas others have limited them, with a number of states also preempting local governments'ability to enact protective measures. State attorneys general have also filed suit challenging the federal government's efforts to guarantee transgender rights. In general, transgender policymaking demonstrates continuity with patterns highlighted in recent federalism scholarship. Consistent with policymaking in other areas in a polarized era, state transgender policymaking is characterized by "variable speed federalism,"whereby certain states move more quickly than others in advancing transgender rights. Additionally, in a development particularly applicable to morality policy, advances in transgender rights in certain states and jurisdictions have sparked backlash in other states and produced emotionally charged interactions leaving little room for bargaining and compromise.  © TheAuthor(s) 2020.},

AlthoughTocqueville's observations speak to these questions, he also transcends them by developing the concepts of governmental and administrative (de)centralization. In differentiating governmental and administrative capacities, Tocqueville offers language by which to understand and evaluate the federal system in terms of the nature of the authority each level of government exercises, rather than simply by the objects of national, state, and municipal powers. The purpose of this article is to clarify Tocqueville's understanding of governmental and administrative (de)centralization and thereby contribute to a better understanding of political authority in theAmerican federal system. © TheAuthor(s) 2018.},

In this article, we evaluate the effectiveness of such an administrative presidency in its ability to withstand political and legal challenges. We first set the context of U.S. energy policy predating the Trump administration, and then synthesize the administration's reversal actions according to the mechanisms, the beneficiaries, and the legal process through which each evolved. We then analyze four reversal case studies that highlight how stakeholders responded to such actions, and the resulting variation in outcomes: the rollback of coal ash standards; the proposed coastal oil and gas auctions; the revocation of California's vehicle emissions waiver; and the replacement of the Clean Power Plan with the Affordable Clean Energy rule. We find that the administration's executive approach was regularly checked through litigation by states, interest groups, and industry, or had limited impact due to the high level of regulatory uncertainty that it fostered. We draw implications for ongoing state and federal dynamics and for the lasting durability of the Trump administration's energy reversal legacy.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Based on a novel network dataset collected by the author, evidence is found for sectoral, political party, and territorial coordination strategies. The main findings are first, that political party coordination in Germany is more frequent than territorial coordination but performs a structuring instead of a substantial function during the coordination process. Second, sectoral coordination mainly takes place at an early stage of the coordination process and is able to solve a bulk of coordination problems by drawing on expert knowledge. © The Author 2017.

We find that the public assigns limited responsibility for hurricane preparedness to governments. Rather, respondents, especially conservatives and those with low trust in government, view individuals themselves as responsible for preparedness. Our results emphasize the role of ideology and the individualistic culture of American politics. These results also have implications for scholars who study individual attribution responsibility in multi-level systems and who may assume that individuals will assign responsibility to one of the various levels of government; however, focusing on disaster preparation in particular, our study shows that a significant number of individuals may not assign responsibility to government at any level. © 2020 The Author(s).

The combination of immigration federalism and congressional fecklessness means that, in spite of radical differences in policy intent, Donald Trump's nativist agenda faces constraints similar to those that undermined Barack Obama's integrationist agenda. The failure to chart a consistent legislative course for national immigration policy has propelled centrifugal forces at the state and local level, with three consequences. First, state and local governments have grown increasingly assertive in pressing their claims to policy authority via legislation, resolutions, executive actions, and court challenges. Second, wide policy differences have emerged across states, as have policy contradictions and conflicts within some states. Finally, while the federal government retains plenary power over immigration policy, the breadth of state and local laws governing immigrant lives increasingly constitutes a de facto encroachment into that authority. © The Author(s) 2018.

This article uses plagiarism detection software to offer a preliminary answer to this question. Our analysis suggests that state officials only occasionally rely on model legislation in drafting resistance measures. It also identifies variation across issues. External sources seem to have the greatest impact on legislation resisting gun control, a more modest influence on challenges to the Affordable Care Act, and a minimal effect on state-level responses to Common Core.

In Asia, some states introduced federalism following decolonization to hold together multiethnic communities, but others centralized and pursued a nation-building agenda. Federalism was not established in Asia again until Nepal's new constitution of 2015. Why has federalism been resisted and what causes its institutionalization? Using the cases of Nepal, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka, I show that a moderate secession risk, together with a substantive peripheral infrastructural capacity, are necessary conditions for the establishment of holding-together federalism. A high secession risk prevents the formation of an alliance between minority ethnic groups and regime change agents from the dominant ethnic group, which I argue is the key mechanism for federalization in these contexts. A bargain with the core results in quasi-federalism for regime maintenance. Conversely, demands for federalism are too easily repressed when secession risk is low. © The Author 2017.

The article's research question is: to what extent was Australia's federal structure responsible for the relative successes and failures of the national pandemic response? The method chosen to answer this question is largely theoretical, supplemented by aspects of institutional and policy analysis. That is to say, the inquiry identifies what were widely considered to be important policies, and considers the extent to which the formulation and implementation of those policies was furthered or hindered by the institutions and relations forming Australia's federal structure. Five policy areas are considered, namely: the National Cabinet; social distancing and related policies; international travel and quarantine; interstate travel; and cities and local government. The conclusions reached are that a number of policy responses achieved federalism's objectives of enhancing local decision-making power, increasing state and federal cooperation, and cabining policy failure.While Australia's was not an unmitigated success story, on the whole the pandemic galvanized and reinvigorated Australia's federal structure and institutions.  © The Author(s) 2021.},

It shows that, overall, there has been a wide-ranging process of legislative centralization, whereas the cantons have retained considerable administrative and, especially, fiscal autonomy. The principal instrument of dynamic centralization has been constitutional change, followed by the enactment of framework legislation by the federal government. The process has unfolded primarily through frequent steps of a small magnitude and occurred throughout the 160-year life of the federation. Modernization, market integration, changing patterns of collective identification, and expectations concerning the role of government appear to have played a particularly important causal role. The multilingual and bi-confessional nature of the country has not presented a major obstacle to this centralization dynamic, particularly since World War II, with the French-speaking minority becoming increasingly pro-centralization. © The Author 2017.

Their struggle to stave off political dissolution raises an important question for scholars of federalism. How can democratic governments integrate disparate political communities across a vast - and rapidly expanding - territory? We revisit the solution most often proposed by contemporary political leaders: a nationally directed system of internal improvements. Using a dataset of nineteenth-century appropriations, we find that patterns in internal improvement funding are consistent with a nation-building strategy. Congressional districts at the fringes of the republic received disproportionate support from the federal government, even after accounting for political preferences, positions of legislative authority, and sub-national spending patterns. Our research stands in contrast to existing work on internal improvements, which is primarily interested in testing theories of distributive politics, and contributes to a diverse body of research on federalism, nation-building, congressional politics, and American political development. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

	abstract = {This article presents the conclusions of the project Why Centralization and Decentralization in Federations?, which analyzed dynamic de/centralization in Australia, Canada, Germany, India, Switzerland, and the United States over their entire life span. It highlights six main conclusions. First, dynamic de/centralization is complex and multidimensional; it cannot be captured by fiscal data alone. Second, while centralization was the dominant trend, Canada is an exception. Third, contrary to some expectations, centralization occurred mainly in the legislative, rather than fiscal, sphere. Fourth, centralization is not only a mid-twentieth century phenomenon; considerable change occurred both before and after. Fifth, variation in centralization across federations appears to be driven by conjunctural causation rather than the net effect of any individual factor. Sixth, institutional properties influence the instruments of dynamic de/centralization but do not significantly affect its direction or magnitude. These findings have important conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical implications for the study of federalism. © The Author(s) 2018.

	abstract = {Policy diffusion studies often infer that learning occurs, but statistical analyses cannot demonstrate it definitively. The spread of medical marijuana offers the opportunity to take a closer look at whether policy and political learning occur during diffusion. An increasing number of states have adopted medical marijuana policies in defiance of federal prohibition and in the space created by federal inactivity. Furthermore, early adopting states have adapted their programs to account for changes in the industry and to coincide with recreational marijuana programs. This article sheds light on how the laws have evolved over time due to policy learning, political learning, and local adaptation. Specifically, we review how states have incorporated best practices from others (policy learning) and how the laws have been repackaged in more politically conservative states (political learning). Finally, we show how states adapt to medical marijuana laws by using precedents from the regulation of other industries. © The Author(s) 2020.

It argues that the nature and the extent of subnational states'engagements in international affairs are a function of the partisan political relationship the state incumbents have with the national incumbents. The article takes a mixed methods approach. An analysis of 1,153 episodes of international engagements of India's states from 1996 to 2017 reveals that shifts in foreign policy engagement of selected state governments primarily reflect alterations in the subnational incumbents' political affiliation with the Union government. Several qualitative case studies shed light on how the central government's inclusion of subnational governments' perspectives and representatives in foreign affairs is highly partisan and profoundly political. Therefore, the Indian case reveals how subnational diplomatic interactions merge domestic and international politics. © 2020 The Author(s).},

In contrast, Leviathan theories argue tax and expenditure limitations (TELs) are necessary to make local governments fiscally responsible. We analyze local taxing behavior in New York State, which implemented a levy limit in 2012 that allows legislative overrides with 60 percent vote of the local governing board. Our 2017 survey of all general-purpose local governments measured fiscal stress, service responses, and local political attitudes and found 38 percent of municipalities voted to override. Logistic regressions show local governments that have more fiscal stress, weaker property tax bases, higher need, and higher employee benefit costs are more likely to override. These findings support fiscal federalism, as local governments that override are pushing back against state policy in order to respond to local needs. TELs introduce unnecessary rigidity and run counter to the precepts of fiscal federalism. © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of CSF Associates: Publius, Inc.

	abstract = {Abortion's centrality to the Christian Right, together with that movement's importance to Republican Party politics, as well as the policy realities of abortion, have all combined to make regulating abortion a fixture within U.S. state politics for decades. While the levels and forms of state activity have varied since the 1980s, theTrump presidency has produced strategic changes in the content and perceived importance of abortion policy. Notably, recent changes in the state politics of abortion have not just been on the side of Republican states restricting abortion access, the most traditional and highest profile form of policy activity in this area, but have also taken the form of Democratic states actively defending abortion access. This article provides an overview of the interrelated changes in party politics, perceptions of political opportunities, and the content of state abortion regulations. It concludes that the frequency of state abortion laws has increased modestly during theTrump presidency, but substantive shifts in recent policies create the potential to fundamentally reorganize state and national abortion politics. © The Author(s) 2020.

We hypothesize that individuals in states running their own exchanges will demonstrate greater support for the ACA and individuals with experience using the exchanges will exhibit greater levels of support for the ACA. Results froma survey conducted in 2016 in Alabama (a federal exchange), Kentucky (a state exchange at the time), and Arkansas (a mixed state-federal exchange) support these hypotheses. These findings are also confirmed using national data from the ANES. We therefore provide evidence that local control over healthcare implementation leads to better outcomes in terms of citizen satisfaction and that citizens who have experience with exchanges established by theACA are more likely to feel positively about the law. © 2019 The Author(s).},

Reference cases have been an important element of Canadian federalism since their creation in 1875 but have not been subject to a comprehensive analysis.

First, through analysis of an original dataset of Canadian appellate reference cases from 1875 to 2017, the article provides an examination of how references have been used by governments, with particular attention to issues related to federalism. Second, the article considers how the reference power can be employed as a political strategy by governments. The reference power demonstrates clear support for the blame avoidance and credit-claiming thesis and provides compelling evidence on how the dynamics of intergovernmental relations can shape a government's decision to delegate decision-making to the courts. © 2018 The Author(s).

Then, the intergovernmental conflict-inducing effect of the Trump presidency during the pandemic was compounded by the vertical integration of political parties, which provided incentives for the President to criticize Democratic governors and vice-versa. Third, the virtual absence of any structure for intergovernmental relations in the United States meant that, unlike Australian states and Canadian provinces, American states struggled to get the federal government's attention and publicly deplored its lack of leadership. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

Federalism alone does not explain the shortcomings of the United States' response to the pandemic. Rather, the fragmented response was driven by state partisanship, which shaped state public health interventions and resulted in differences in public health outcomes. This has sobering implications for American federalism because state-level partisan differences yield different and unequal responses to the pandemic. © The Author(s) 2021.},

I find mixed results; even though there was some evidence to suggest greater policy activity, most new actions taken by school districts were incremental changes. Further, there was little ideological differentiation in adopted policies despite variation in districts' partisan composition. Small districts were slightly more likely to experiment than larger ones, supporting the hypothesis that smaller jurisdictions are more nimble and flexible and thus more likely to enact policy change.

	abstract = {The theory of congruence in comparative federalism holds that institutional design will, eventually, reflect societal divisions by transferring central powers to new, autonomous entities. While this model helps to understand why many divided societies adopt federalism, it cannot explain why only certain unitary states transform into federal ones while others do not. We use a historical institutionalism approach to identify the critical junctures in the trajectory of two prominent plural polities, Belgium and Lebanon. We suggest that the politicization of identities during initial stages of state-building plays a major role in the transformation of a unitary state into a federationçwhich occurs in the former but not in the latter of our cases. The current contrast in both consociational democracies is explained here as a legacy of the late nineteenth century, which set in motion decisive logics of public governance that direct institutional dynamics until today. © 2020 The Author(s).},

Concurrently, extreme weather, rising sea levels, and other climatic effects have increased the salience of climate change in the mass public and among elected officials. In response, legislators in state governments increasingly introduce and adopt policies associated with climate change. In this article, we evaluate the state of climate change policymaking in state legislatures, with a focus on overall trends in climate mitigation and adaptation innovation and cases of policy retrenchment. We document an increased level of climate legislation introduced in U.S. states since President Trump's election, particularly in states under Democratic Party control. We evaluate patterns of introduced legislation across the states between 2011 and 2019 and consider the factors associated with bill sponsorship. Our results demonstrate the increased partisan nature of climate change policymaking in U.S. states. © The Author(s) 2020.

One of the primary justifications for legislative malapportionment-the disparity between the share of legislative seats and the share of the national population-is interregional income equalization by means of favorable allocations of resources to rural areas through overrepresentation. By analyzing the case of Brazil using instrumental variables, this study evaluates the theoretical argument and the empirical validity of the presumed mechanism linking unequal representation to regional development and national economic convergence. It argues that in contexts of undeveloped democracies, rather than convergence, disproportionate resource transfers via overrepresentation hinder the development of beneficiary regions. The empirical analyses of Brazilian states indicate that while overrepresented jurisdictions do receive disproportionate shares of resources from the federal government, disproportionate resource transfers, and dependence on resource transfers attributable to overrepresentation hamper the development potential of those regions. © 2018 The Author(s).

We argue that lawmakers, whose careers rest in the hands of provincial constituencies, administer the legislative process to promote bills that protect the federal transfers that finance vertical fiscal imbalances and to amend proposals that seek to change them. Using an expert-coded dataset designed to assess the direction and magnitude of tax policy change, as described by the amendments proposed by legislators to the full set of tax bills proposed to the Argentine Congress since 1983, we document the legislative dynamics underpinning the common-pool problems of decentralized fiscal federal arrangements. © 2020 The Author(s).},

I take the opportunity, fifteen years after theAct's passage and approaching a key October 2020 deadline, to analyze and explain how federal officials overcame obstacles to REAL ID implementation, especially resistance from elected state officials. I conclude that the role of administrative officials within the Department of Homeland Security and their ability to work with administrative officials in state Department of Motor Vehicle offices was critical to overcoming state resistance and leading states to come into alignment with REAL ID requirements. A key lesson is that overcoming state^federal conflict in policy implementation is possible when administrative officials at the state and federal level are key actors and can collaborate and perceive common interests.

It thereby builds on but specifies arguments from the literature on horizontal federalism that has usually been focusing on general institutional and societal factors to explain cooperation. These factors capture how a given policy problem unfolds (problem pressure), the ways in which subnational governments are exposed to and experience its consequences in similar or unequal ways (functional interdependencies and their symmetry), and how the issues are treated domestically (problem awareness). We illustrate the potential importance of these factors by analyzing treaties among Swiss substates in the water domain and relying on network analytic methods. We find that problem awareness and functional interdependencies and their (a)symmetries are important, whereas problem pressure has a mixed influence, depending on the issue area. © 2020 The Author(s).},

Using a sample of 100 large cities in the United States from 1995 to 2011, this study examines the effects of TELs on revenue reliance by source and shows that cities with more restrictive TELs do not have higher reliance on non-property-Tax revenues. In a sample that includes only cities with TELs, the results suggest that cities subject to more restrictive TELs rely more on sales taxes and less on user fees. © The Author(s) 2018.

The results indicate that the diffusion of NMS laws is driven by two forms of interstate economic competition, a policy competition effect that operates primarily among contiguous neighbors and a cost competition effect that operates primarily among a broader set of economic peers.

Our evidence confirms that state identities are still highly relevant in shaping American federalism and the competitive pressures between intergovernmental jurisdictions.

	abstract = {This article addresses the debate about the relative utility of accommodative federalism as a method of conflict management in multinational states. Comparative scholarship on this issue assumes that territorial reform translates into political stability or instability through policy substance. This article tests that assumption against processes of institutional accommodation of Catalan and Quebecois demands for autonomy and recognition.The comparison demonstrates the absence of a linear relationship between institutional change and political instability. When autonomy for minority regions is extended without symbolic recognition, subsequent majority response unfolds in the policy arena, mostly through attempts to symmetrize autonomy arrangements (self-amplifying sequence). However, when the extension of territorial autonomy is combined with formal symbolic recognition, it paves the way for majority political backlash (reactive sequence). Open political opposition by a segment of majority political community, in turn, stimulates secessionist sentiment among members of minority community. © The Author 2017.

This was qualified at the time as a diminished or "quasi"form of federalism. Existing explanations of the origins of India's centralized federalism focus on efforts to curb further secession attempts in the aftermath of Partition or the need for a strong Center to consolidate democracy in a highly unequal society. This article draws on archival materials to demonstrate that distinctive elements of Indian federalism were shaped at their foundations by the desire to boost industrial development and lay the foundation for a national welfare state in a post-colonial future by preventing the consolidation of "race to the bottom"dynamics arising from unregulated inter-provincial economic competition. © 2021 The Author(s).

Since the 1890s, when the first forest reserves (now national forests) were established, there have been calls to transfer much of the federally managed public lands to states for their management or sell them to private interests. There has also been a century-plus disagreement over natural-resources use versus protection of these same lands.

Second, I examine the Trump administration’s approach to implementing the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 (ESSA), especially in reviewing state plans pursuant to the ESSA.

In this article, we compare Catalonia, Quebec, and South Tyrol with regard to their legal capacity to develop their societal culture by their own autonomous institutions. In doing so, we identify six legally oriented pillars that are central for a minority nation to sustain its societal culture, on the one hand, and that are fundamental for a multinational (quasi)federation to feed a healthy democratic and hospitable environment for all, on the other hand. Those pillars form the building blocks of the Societal Culture Index, which allows measuring and comparing minority nations by combining normative studies and empirical research. Hence, we argue that governance in (quasi)federal system will be improved to the extent that minority nations score as high as possible on the Index. © The Author 2017.

Building on these findings, and adopting a dynamic approach, this article investigates the effect of changes of the ballot structure on party system nationalization and shows that this effect is conditioned by levels of ethno-geographic concentration and political decentralization. Specifically, candidate-centered reforms hamper party system nationalization by making parties less likely to obtain similar vote shares across constituencies, whereas party-centered reforms tend to foster it. Moreover, concentration of ethnic groups at the district level or considerable political decentralization exacerbates the impact of candidate-centered changes. These effects are demonstrated through an analysis of an original dataset of electoral reforms and party system nationalization as measured with different indices across fifty-nine democracies and more than five hundred legislative elections. © The Author 2017.

Carefully planned institutional re-designs are the most visible expression thereof. Yet the Great Recession of 2007-2009 has pushed governments into the opposite direction, i.e., towards centralization, to better weather the fiscal drought. Given these contradictory developments, this article compares the effects of twenty-three separate state reforms with the impact of the Great Recession on fiscal centralization in twenty-nine countries over more than two decades. In the main, our analyses attribute a larger effect to design, i.e., pro-active policy making through reforms, than reactive crisis management after a great shock. However, this difference is only apparent once we consider a state's institutional structure, that is whether a political system is unitary or federal. Our findings thus highlight the need for a multidimensional approach to better understand the drivers of fiscal de/centralization.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Even though employment regulation is an area where states claim statutory and court-backed authority and therefore where states might have been expected to act independently of the federal government, state employment, and workplace laws are in many cases aligned with federal policy. The significant degree of alignment of state and federal law in this area reveals how states face downward pressures from federal efforts to regulate and crack down on immigration broadly, and unauthorized immigrants specifically.This, in turn, suggests that immigration federalism scholarship, which has generally highlighted state^ federal conflict in the area of policing and enforcement, needs to account for different types of intergovernmental relationships that accompany distinctive immigrant policy areas, and researchers should consider the different spheres where enforcement occurs. © The Author(s) 2020.

It is suggested that, while the distribution of authority between central and regional governments matters, policy dynamics - that is, how different territorial levels interact in policy-making processes - are even more important in driving multi-level responses to the emergency.

We point to limitations that have beset the analysis of territorial politics and suggest how recent advances in CHA offer a promising approach to avoid and overcome existing shortcomings. We also demonstrate and illustrate the ways that vertical and horizontal dimensions of territorial structures evolve over time, from the moment they are created to subsequent episodes of reform. Our aim is to show that time has causal relevance in connecting past and present patterns of change and continuity, and thus in capturing the formative and developmental pathways of changes in territorial authority. © The Author 2017.

Conventionally, we tend to view controversy over judicial federalism through the lens of the Jeffersonian and Jacksonian eras, in which this appellate oversight functioned to consolidate the power of national institutions against the periphery and defenders of states' rights promoted the independence of state courts from federal oversight. But the deliberative process that attended the formation of the federal judiciary exhibited a more complex dynamic that presented the framers of the Constitution and of the first judiciary act with a range of possible institutional arrangements. Given the available alternatives, the Supreme Court's appellate oversight was not so much an aggression on states' rights as a concession to those wary of consolidation. Rather than being contested, it in fact formed a ground of consensus as a modest means of ensuring federal supremacy. © The Author 2017.

In this article, I challenge this claim, demonstrating that this alignment is contingent on the level of party system nationalization. These consequences have not been fully documented. Using DW-NOMINATE to calculate Argentine legislators' ideal points (1983-2017), I show that individual territorialization in roll call voting increases when the party system is more decentralized. Legislators are closer to their provincial delegation, irrespective of which party they belong to, when there are low levels of party nationalization. At the individual level, this mechanism may be understood by the competing principals' theory: because party system decentralization implies a response to local dynamics over national dynamics, cross-pressured legislators may favor their subnational principal.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

This mixed-methods study of Brazil, Mexico, and the United States finds that state-level variation in the stringency of social distancing policies is driven not by the epidemiological, demographic, or socioeconomic factors commonly emphasized in previous research, but largely by political factors. Introducing a novel framework for explaining pandemic policymaking, the study shows the central importance of political parties, presidential power, and governors' coalitions in determining state-level policy stringency. In the United States and Mexico, statistical and qualitative evidence indicates that interstate collaboration among governors, combined with top-down pressures from national party elites and presidents, led to greater policy alignment among coordinated states. In Brazil, in contrast, where there is little evidence of either policy coordination or alignment, state-level policies resulted instead from intrastate factors and diffusion. Together, these findings highlight how a multilevel framework attuned to varied combinations of intra-unit, cross-unit, and cross-level causal factors strengthens our understanding of pandemic policymaking. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

We present a theoretical model where a "benevolent government"invests in research and development (R&D) aiming at maximizing net income, and R&D results are subject to interregional knowledge spillovers. The model predicts that decentralization leads to a lower level of public spending on innovation, and to a lower share of basic research in the government R&D budget. These hypotheses are empirically tested using country aggregate data. The results provide empirical support to the mentioned hypotheses, as we find evidence that higher levels of both expenditure and revenue decentralization are associated with a lower intensity of basic research in public R&D and with a lower level of R&D spending. The strength of the evidence, however, is weakened by the small sample size and shortcomings of the indicators used in the analysis. © 2019 The Author(s).},

While many Republican-controlled states followed their national allies and rejected Medicaid expansion, others engaged in bipartisan implementation. Why were some Republican states willing to reject the national partisan agenda and cooperate with Democrats in Washington? I focus on the role of electoral competition within states. I conclude that although electoral competition has been shown to encourage partisan polarization within the states, the combination of intergovernmental implementation and Medicaid expansion's association with public welfare reverses this dynamic. I employ a Cox proportional-hazards model to examine the impact of state partisan ideology and competition on the likelihood of state Medicaid expansion. I find that strong inter-party competition mitigates the impact of more extreme partisan ideologies, encouraging potentially bipartisan negotiation with the federal administration. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Two themes are highlighted in this essay. First, major policy changes continue to be undertaken primarily through unilateral executive action, even with Republicans holding the presidency and both the House and Senate. Ideological divisions within the Republican Party prevented Congress from enacting major legislation, save for a tax reform measure, and resulted in policy changes on health care, immigration, and the environment being made through executive and administrative action. Another prominent feature of governance in the early part of theTrump administration has been state resistance to federal directives, taking the form primarily but not exclusively of state attorney general (AG) lawsuits. Democratic AGs filed lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions on immigration and clean energy in particular. Democratic governors and state legislators also took a variety of other actions to resist Trump administration policies. The federal courts also continue to play an active role in shaping and adjudicating controversies impacting federalism. © The Author(s) 2018.

In making use of data from the 2011 Canadian election study (CES), we explore both attitudes toward Quebec in general and the willingness to do more for Quebec, which we refer to respectively as "affective attitudes" and "policy attitudes." Our findings demonstrate the key role played by generalized prejudice and perceptions of how one's province is treated in the Canadian federation in structuring both sets of attitudes. The impact of Canadian identity, on the other hand, is more limited.

This study investigates the relationship between (national and provincial) attachments and attitudes toward ethnocultural diversity in the Canadian federation. Our findings indicate that stronger attachments to Canada lead to more positive attitudes toward ethnocultural diversity in all provinces. They also demonstrate that provincial attachments relate to attitudes toward ethnocultural diversity both in a minority nation provincial context (Quebec) and in other provinces (Alberta and Saskatchewan), but that the direction of this relationship can be of opposite direction than that for attachment to Canada.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {American local government financing shifted fromtaxation toward user fees and charges (UFCs) in the late1970s, with substantial efficiency and equity implications. Normatively, the shift aligns with the benefit principle; positively, the shift is often attributed to tax revolts. We test the two associations via a difference-In-differences design and a fiscal stringency measure of tax and expenditure limitations (TELs); we also test the moderating effects of overrides on TELs. Our results confirm that state-Imposed TELs caused the shift in local public finance; the results are robust to change of sample and empirical strategy. This article helps explain the relationship between tax revolts and non-tax revenue and provides evidence that fiscal constraints imposed by a higher level government on a constituent level can have significant effects, Including effects beyond the intent of the constraints' framers. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the eight years since the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable CareAct (ACA), state governments have remained critical sites of contention over the law. Intense partisan conflict over ACA implementation has raised questions about traditional theories of intergovernmental relations, which posit that federal^state cooperation depends largely on policy design. Yet, few studies have examined how partisanship, as well as other important factors, shape state policy innovations under the ACA. This article examines the ACA's State Innovation Models (SIM) initiative. SIM is specifically geared towards incentivizing states to experiment with new models of payment and delivery that can improve health outcomes and/or reduce health-care costs. Drawing on a combination of quantitative and qualitative evidence, we find that states' participation in SIM is shaped by partisanship, administrative capacity, and state policy legacies. Our findings have implications for future efforts at intergovernmental health reforms. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of CSF Associates: Publius, Inc.

For the empirical part of our study, we focus on the German Bundesrat and its committees. Based on the protocols of their meetings, we developed a new dataset that contains information on more than 51,000 roll call votes, the largest-ever empirical basis to study interest representation and decision-making in the Bundesrat. Above all, we find that partisanship plays a role, yet a minor one.

Yet, members of the two parties did not agree on that division of intergovernmental responsibility. Rather, across a variety of issues, polarized partisan identities structured beliefs about the operation and efficacy of the American federal system's ability to contend with the spread of coronavirus. Moreover, these beliefs did not stem from prior ideological commitments or the different composition of Democratic or Republican communities. Instead, party leaders proved especially capable of shifting public attitudes on questions of federal versus state authority through their shifting rhetoric and strategic framing. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

After identifying several strategies for the management of diversity, the article traces the factors which account for a predominantly group-dominant approach to diversity in Pakistan and an integrationist approach in India. The analysis highlights the relevance of structural antecedent conditions during colonial times: namely the accommodationist tradition within Congress, and the absence thereof in Pakistan (Muslim League) and the group-dominant legacy of the military and civil service. The comparison also draws attention to gradual processes of change within a dominant path and nuances the relevance of elections as sufficient mechanisms for strengthening accommodation. For elections to fulfil this accommodationist potential, they need to be embedded within a liberal constitutional framework. © The Author 2017.

By explaining the logic and the effects of combining two types of federal spending, discretionary and non-discretionary, this article uncovers an additional driver that contributes to understanding policymaking and its implementation not only in Argentina, but potentially in other robust federal systems such as Brazil, Canada, and the United States. Using original data on federal infrastructure and programmatic social welfare spending for the twenty-four provinces of Argentina between 2003 and 2015, we provide empirical evidence that both forms of spending penalize opposition districts and more populated urban provinces (regardless of partisan affinity), and thus undercut the ability of key governors to become future presidential challengers. This research suggests that presidents of territorially diverse federations with strong governors can utilize the dual-punishment spending strategy to alter the balance of power, reinforcing the dominance of the center. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Despite expectations that forces of modernization and globalization centralize federations, Canada's overall ''federal balance'' has remained largely stable since 1867. Early in the federation's life, there was decentralization in the fiscal realm and in a few policy fields (e.g., finance and securities as well as employment relations). The last several decades have witnessed decentralization in several policy fields, such as agriculture, citizenship, and immigration, and natural resource, but also centralization in such crucial ones as social welfare and language. The overall slight decentralist path of the Canadian federation occurred primarily through non-constitutional means. Court decisions played a significant role in shaping this path early on, but it is the territorial diversity of the country, primarily but not exclusively nationalism in Quebec, along with the original centralized nature of the Canadian federation, that fundamentally accounts for why Canada has not centralized like so many other federations. © The Author 2017.},

In some cases, however, diverse advocacy coalitions have overcome fractious federalism to pass expansion legislation in deeply Republican states. More recently, such coalitions have resorted to ballot initiative campaigns as another means of overcoming such polarization, and won impressive victories in a series of "deep red"states. Drawing on forty-four interviews with people involved in expansion advocacy in eleven states, I report important insights on the formation and activities of these coalitions in both the legislative and ballot initiative eras of Medicaid expansion politics.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

The article focuses on how institutional regionalization changed citizens' attitudes about the division of competences between the central and regional level. It argues that regional institutions and policies exert a socializing effect on citizens' preference in favor of these institutions through a mechanism of adaptive preferences. First, attitudes are studied across cohorts in a single population to test whether cohorts that came of age in a context of more institutional regionalization are more favorable towards regional decision-making than cohorts that came of age in a centralized state. The analyses indeed show evidence for a socializing effect of institutional regionalization. Second, the article shows how regional elites' discourses may moderate the relationship between institutional regionalization and citizens' attitudes about regionalization. We study Belgium as a crucial case. We use five cross-sectional datasets of the Flemish and Walloon populations during the course of increased regionalization in Belgium (1991-2007).  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

As both a public health and economic crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has put unique fiscal pressures on subnational governments. This article reviews the pandemic's fiscal effects on these governments, as well as the federal government's response. By comparing the response to the COVID-19 crisis during the Trump administration with the response to the Great Recession during the Obama administration, we show that while the speed and magnitude of federal aid was unprecedented in 2020, it was nevertheless conditional in nature and beset by familiar political and institutional obstacles. Despite major fiscal pressures, state revenues rebounded earlier than expected, in part due to the relaxation of public health measures and the collection of taxes from online transactions; yet, state resources remained strained throughout the year, especially in states reliant on the hospitality and the oil sectors. And while local property taxes were buoyed by a surging housing market, cities and counties were confronted with declining revenue from other sources and intense emergency spending needs. Thus, despite unprecedented levels of federal support for state and local governments, the legacies of "fend for yourself"federalism live on. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Most Republican governors behaved as members of a vertical partisan coalition supporting the national party rather than defending insurance coverage in their states. But the activities of a significant minority of these governors impeded ACA retrenchment.We also examine the role of executive federalism, highlighting how state responses toTrump administrative initiatives affected ACA durability. The Trump administration drew on waivers, executive orders, funding decisions, administrative rules, the social media, and other executive branch tools to sabotage the health insurance exchanges and undercut Medicaid. As of 2018, the Trump administration actions had contributed to some erosion in exchange coverage, but far less than many had anticipated. The degree to which Medicaid waivers encouraged by the Trump administration will precipitate enrollment declines in that program remains to be seen. © The Author(s) 2018.

	abstract = {Popular and scientific contributions often call for increased regional decision-making power to manage secessionist conflict, assuming that fiscally federalized countries are less prone to disintegrate politically. From a theoretical standpoint this is not clear though, as federalism creates an institutional paradox where autonomous legislative and bureaucratic structures can potentially be used to make secessionism a viable strategy in the first place. In particular, the role of asymmetric territorial arrangements in this association is crucially underexplored at present. Using electoral data on separatist political movements from a large variety of European regions since the mid-1990s, our findings indicate that regions with comparatively higher fiscal and institutional autonomy are more prone to vote for secessionist parties. Accounting for possible endogeneity, asymmetric territorial self-governance seems to cause much stronger incentives to vote for secessionist platforms, while the association with fiscally more symmetric arrangements is surprisingly small. © The Author 2017.

	abstract = {During the Trump Administration, state attorneys general (AGs) have become entrenched as integral policymaking actors in the United States. Their expanding policymaking role fits broader patterns of polarized politics, as partisan coalitions of AGs are increasingly willing to sue the federal government, a trend that gathered steam in the Obama Administration and has reached a crescendo in Trump's first year. However, state AGs do cooperate, particularly in corporate litigation to address allegedly widespread, illegal behavior. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of multi-state lawsuits and Supreme Court amicus briefs, we identify continuity and change in how AGs have employed their powers, by examining their activities during the first year of the Trump presidency and placing these activities in the context of previous administrations. This analysis is accompanied by a pair of case studies, one on conflictual AG environmental litigation and another on bipartisan efforts to address the opioid epidemic. Both demonstrate AG's prominent policymaking power, a power unlikely to abate anytime soon. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of CSF Associates: Publius, Inc.

This article focuses on constitutional courts as one of such institutions. It constructs a classification for measuring a court's position in federalism disputes and tests hypotheses about what determines variation across decisions within one court. The case study is Belgium, as a model of contemporary fragmenting systems. We find that if the defending party is the federal government, the probability of a centralist outcome increases compared to when a sub-state government is the defendant, and vice versa. Evidence suggests that legal merit plays a role to this effect. We further find that each state reform decreases the probability of a centralist outcome. This appears to be a consequence of strategic considerations. We finally find suggestive evidence that the organization of the court does not fully succeed in playing down judges' ideological preferences. © 2018 The Author(s).

After first identifying and discussing state preemption laws across twenty-one diverse public policies, we investigate how political, institutional, and demographic factors predict the implementation of these laws. Our empirical analysis reveals that states where Republicans control both legislative chambers and the governorship, with more politically conservative citizens, a higher percentage of African Americans, and a stronger conservative interest group presence passes more laws that preempt local policymaking. Our results demonstrate that state preemption efforts are more closely associated with political and demographic factors and less associated with institutional forces. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

	abstract = {China launched a massive poverty alleviation program in the 1990s that focused on nationally designated poverty counties. By injecting earmarked transfers with clear spending mandates, the central government hoped for major investments in productive capacities in the poverty counties so they could develop sustainably. Comparing fiscal data of county governments through a regression discontinuity approach, we show that the opposite was true. Poverty county officials failed to make extra investments in production-oriented areas while diversion of central transfers for administrative consumption was rampant. This article develops a better empirical strategy to challenge some earlier findings. Theoretically, this article offers a different case of elite capture under a non-democratic regime. Our focus on poverty regions also reveals the importance of maintaining bureaucratic support in local politics. It complements the popular notion that Chinese local officials are mostly geared toward growth. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

I examine early state experimentation with methods of choosing presidential electors, at a time when several prominent founders viewed the district system as the most principled method. I also focus on developments after the 1824 election, when Congress rejected a constitutional amendment requiring states to adopt the district system and the general ticket system grew in popularity. I show that it was in the course of these debates in the 1820s that the general ticket system acquired a new principled defense: that it best represented state majorities in the presidential selection process. This analysis enhances our understanding of one of the political safeguards of federalism, by explaining the entrenchment of state authority over the mode of choosing electors as well as adoption and justification of the general ticket system. © 2015 The Author.},

In 2010, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness started the first national-level comprehensive strategic plan on homelessness: Opening Doors. The Opening Doors plan highlights intergovernmental partnerships as effective tools to implement federal homeless programs to different levels of governments in order to achieve federal outcomes. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, we find that county governments that align their homelessness program with the federal and state government have better program outcomes than those that do not align intergovernmentally. Our findings help to expand our understanding of intergovernmental mechanisms as effective policy tools to achieve federal program outcomes at the local level in the absence of financial inducements or legal mandates. © The Author 2017.

To date, critics have struggled to make a convincing case on either point. This article examines empirically the viability of institutional alternatives to ethnofederalism. Based on data drawn from post 1945 and using a "same-system" comparative design, the results indicate that where ethnofederal systems have failed, they have generally failed in contexts where no institutional alternatives could plausibly have succeeded, and that in the majority of cases, ethnofederalism has succeeded where other institutional forms have demonstrably failed. © 2015 The Author.},

Democrats have reinforced the partisan divide by declining to debate the constitutionality of their policies, instead invoking supposedly settled judicial precedent; and by enabling President Obama to create new federal policy through direct negotiation with like-minded states, thus circumventing congressional obstruction. Ironically, both parties appear willing to shrink the power and authority of an already diminished Congress, a development with unsettling implications for the future. © 2016 The Author 2016.

In a second step, I discuss whether these new sub-central competences have led to an increase in spatial educational inequalities.The results indicate that federal states make use of the new competences in a rational manner. Higher teacher pay, in turn, has a significant and conducive effect on the outcome of the federal states' education sectors. There is some evidence that this has led to increasing spatial inequalities; however, the evidence is not unambiguous. © The Author 2017.

Are they driven by partisan motives, where they like devolution the most when the President is of the opposing party? Or are calls to shift the balance of federal power rooted in sincere support for decentralized political authority? Using survey data from 1987 to 2012, I explore how support for devolution varies across time and individuals. I find that people are not strictly partisan in how they think about devolution. While people are more likely to favor decentralization when the President is of the opposing party, they are no more likely to want devolution when their own party controls state government. Substantive considerations are also important, where those who support limited government increasingly favor the devolution of central authority as the size of the national government increases relative to the size of state and local government. © 2016 The Author.},

The Act granted state officials significant discretionary authority over the implementation of health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion. Decisions by state officials vary from full state involvement to partial involvement to refusal to administer a state health exchange or expand Medicaid. The federal government administers a health exchange in those states choosing not to operate an exchange. The article examines whether variation in state program choices affects citizen decisions to enroll in an exchange. Also examined is whether health insurance premiums vary by which level of government administers the exchange. The analysis provides evidence that the Act's goals of increased enrollment in health insurance and affordable premiums are influenced by state government decisions on the extent of state involvement in health exchanges and Medicaid expansion. © 2016 The Author 2016.

We argue that such accounts overlook how federal-state collaboration has been critical to achieving Obama Administration ends. Partisan polarization has gridlocked Congress and made the President dependent on the states to advance his central policy initiatives. As a result, these initiatives are both more responsive to state demands and more bipartisan than they might appear. After exploring tools by which the President works with the states, we discuss implications for federalism, the separation of powers, and partisan polarization. In particular, the state role in shaping federal regulation raises the possibility that states are both aggrandizing and checking presidential power. © 2016 The Author 2016.

Faced with partisan gridlock in Congress - which was not able to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) until the last year in office - the Obama Administration opted to make education policy through creative, expansive, and controversial uses of executive power that changed the national political discourse around education and pushed states to enact important policy changes regarding charter schools, common core standards and assessments, and teacher evaluation. The administration's aggressive efforts on school reform, however, eventually led to a political backlash against those same reforms and federal involvement in education more generally and resulted in an ESEA reauthorization (the 2015 Every Student Succeeds Act) that rolls back the federal role in K-12 schooling in important ways. One of the enduring legacies of the Obama presidency may well be the invigoration and expansion of the state role in education. © 2016 The Author 2016.

Building on the literature on the origins and persistence of federalism, the analysis reveals that the choice for decentralization in European microstates was made largely according to patterns suggested by the general literature, whereas insular identities and colonial legacies provide the strongest explanations for the origins of federalism in the African, Caribbean, and Pacific cases.

These decisions are not only rooted in First Amendment jurisprudence but also raise issues of federalism. Although most studies of federal-state conflict focus on disputes between state officials and elected federal policy makers, courts are also policy-making institutions, and in the absence of policy making by other federal branches, courts have become the critical federal policy maker in this area. In response to U.S. Supreme Court rulings that deregulate campaign finance rules and are out of step with the policy preferences of many state electorates and officials, states are attempting to resist these rulings, but using different approaches than are used by states in disputes with the Congress or President. We discuss these rulings and state responses to them. We also describe the implications of these dynamics for federalism. © The Author 2017.},

In assessing these developments and their implications, insight can be gained by contrasting current practices against a benchmark of past intergovernmental relationships and practices, as provided by the federalism scholarship of Martha Derthick. Her studies explored the normative dimensions of the American federal system, the role of administrative practices and intergovernmental bargaining in the system's evolution and functioning, and the role of the states. She was particularly concerned about the consequences of policy centralization and congressional and bureaucratic hyperactivity; moreover, her belief in intergovernmental consultation and legislative deliberation was starkly at odds with today's poisonous partisan polarization. Engaging with Derthick's writings on these topics helps inform our assessment of the current system. © The Author 2017.},

This article answers these questions through a comparative-historical analysis of territorial restructuring in Belgium, Spain, and the UK. It shows that ''holding-together'' federations are created during a critical juncture opened by a surge of regional nationalism and that the strategic responses of mainstream parties to this threat are conditioned by their ideology and their ability to ''credibly'' deploy accommodative strategies. These constitutional settlements put countries on a path of institutional development that is conditioned by mainstream parties' ideational adaptation to the political foundations of the federation and by their power in the system of inter-governmental relations. Even when regionalist parties regain control of the agenda, mainstream parties' ideological adherence to the norms enshrined in the constitutions, coupled with their resilient power in the system of intergovernmental relations, means that institutional change is gradual. These insights bear relevance for institutional theory and for comparative federalism. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of CSF Associates: Publius, Inc.

Analysis of case studies in three nested geographic contexts (internationally, interstate United States and interstate Mexico) generates evidence of opportunistic behavior and either limited or disputed compliance both internationally and within each country. Structural safeguards have stipulated powers and functions for water allocation and conflict resolution in all three settings, but roles and responsibilities are not clear during droughts. The limitations of structural, popular, and judicial safeguards have elevated the importance of joint monitoring, which we identify as a vital new form of safeguard. © 2016 The Author.},

Scholars note that Democrats and Republicans routinely employ preemption to advance partisan political goals, but we know very little about how each party uses this tool of federal power. Are policymakers from both parties employing preemption in similar ways, or do strategic partisan differences exist? Using an original dataset, we show that Democrats and Republicans systematically vary in their use of preemption. Democrats put forward preemption legislation that maximizes regulation by mandating a floor of protection across the states, particularly for policies that promote consumer protection and expand civil rights. In contrast, Republicans enact preemptions that cap regulation by utilizing ceilings that curtail the states' ability to regulate, particularly for business and commerce policy. Ultimately, both parties have enhanced federal power and limited state authority, but they do so in dramatically different ways and for vastly different political goals. © 2016 The Author.},

These factors are found to be weakly or not at all associated with citizen evaluations and perceptions of regional equity and subordination. Instead, in all countries, public trust in the various orders of government, especially the federation government, is most associated with perceptions of regional equity and regional subordination.

In addition, our results indicate that federations have an indirect positive impact on women's representation: first, they facilitate the adoption of gender quotas; second, they allow women to enter parliament earlier than unitary states. © 2015 The Author.},

A range of issues that were largely ignored when the initiative was adopted, including concerns over cost, teacher evaluation, accountability, and student privacy were brought to the fore as the policy had to be reconciled with existing systems and institutions.

Beyond the well-known device of "fiscal appeasement," central governments facing potential secessionist challenges try to hamstring regional tax collection and permit regional protectionism against goods and labor. While ethnic diversity has helped to preserve relatively robust forms of fiscal federalism in Canada and Switzerland, it has had the contrary effect in developing countries. Even among Western democracies, those governments unwilling to countenance secession are less likely to respond to secessionist challenges by decentralizing taxation powers.

However, when the principle is denuded of its moral foundations in this fashion it not only fails to provide the grounding for achieving human dignity and the common good, but may also become the harbinger of fiscal crises and social dysfunction. We provide a more comprehensive account of the principle of subsidiarity and contrast this with various conceptions prominently presented in the federalism literature.We then explore how this more comprehensive view of subsidiarity would look in practice.

	abstract = {The Obama Administration attracted significant attention in June 2014 when it proposed widely varying greenhouse gas emission-reduction targets for each state's electricity sector. This article examines the bases for these varying targets, concluding that they may present a new model of cooperative federalism, in two senses. Under cooperative federalism's traditional structure, the federal government is the standard-setting body and states are the implementers of those standards. Under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Power Plan, however, the federal government uses state policies to provide the content for the federal standards, essentially "federalizing" state environmental policies. The Plan also pegs state emissions targets to a state's capacity to reduce emissions, as opposed to a state's contribution to greenhouse gas concentrations. EPA's approach unquestionably enhances states as laboratories of democracy and addresses collective active problems. It also facilitates the economic and political feasibility of climate-change mitigation efforts. Nevertheless, for states and environmental policymaking going forward, it may also present issues of fairness and perverse incentives. © The Author 2015.},

It explores the circumstances that lead courts to take a centralist or, more interestingly, a noncentralist stance in disputes between national and subnational governments. Several hypotheses are tested, relying on a sample of eleven federations, with attention to institutional features such as the extent of subnational representation in federal policymaking, the degree of integration of the party system, the role of states in the appointment of judges and composition of the court, the extent of decentralization of the federal system, and the devolutionary and multinational nature of the federation. Courts seem more likely to take a noncentralist stance in the presence of weak representation of subnational governments at the federal level, a low centralization gradient or, in particular, the context of a devolutionary multinational state. In contrast, low representation of states in selection of judges or composition of the courts seem to encourage a more centralist stance. © The Author 2016.},

Focusing on three dimensions of government autonomy-local government capacity, local government discretion, and local government importance-I find that the growth of certain types of special districts is in part a response to state laws constraining government autonomy of generalpurpose governments. The findings also suggest that reliance on special districts by local generalpurpose governments would decrease if they had stronger own-source revenue-raising capacities andmore diversified tax revenue bases. In contrast with prior studies, the analysis provides limited evidence to support the notion that special districts are formed by general-purpose governments to circumvent fiscal restrictions, such as debt limits and tax and expenditure limitations. © The Author 2016.},

Recently, however, several scholars have argued that even if Americans do not make legalistic or theoretical references to federalism, they often think intuitively about intergovernmental politics. This study presents the results of a three-part survey experiment designed to assess how readily individuals come to think about federalism when evaluating public policy. In general, individuals do not consider the intergovernmental implications of policy, even when asked to explicitly compare two levels of government. Overwhelmingly, individual preference for government activity obscures concerns for federalism in eight of nine substantive policy domains. Yet, this indeterminacy does not mean that public opinion is irrelevant for studies of American federalism. Rather, it is a highly malleable instrument that political elites can use to leverage public support for policies. © The Author 2017.

The analysis focuses on four factors that shape the perception of SCC justices as representatives for Quebec: the competing normative positions related to the nature of the Canadian federation and the ideal judicial role in a liberal democracy, along with the institutional features of the Court related to the appointment process and bijuralism. Through a review of public statements by justices and key decisions that are critically important to Quebec's place in the federation, the article argues that among SCC justices from Quebec there are different understandings of what it means to act as a representative. © 2016 The Author.},

However, we demonstrate that, despite the broadly decentralized development of cultural administration in Spain - a plurinational and multicultural state - different recent judicial and political processes are distorting the quasi-federalism constructed over the past three decades.

Meanwhile, state transfers influence choices for less collaborative arrangements among more urbanized areas.

Banfield, favors a pragmatic blending and balancing of national and federal elements to create healthy communities with the objective of fostering self-government. This understanding rejects three popular notions of federalism-federalism as policy efficiency, states' rights federalism, and political process federalism. In contrast with these alternative approaches, Derthick develops a principled stand for federalism that opposes commandeering of states and supports representative self-government. © The Author 2017.},

	abstract = {This article studies the main factors that affect the allocation of non-earmarked federal funds to subnational units in Argentina between 1999 and 2009. The main contribution is that it brings presidential popularity together with presidential structural and partisan preferences for distribution into the analysis. It argues that electorally strong and popular presidents tend to increase transfers to developing districts and reduce allocations to richer districts. Investing in developing provinces is more efficient, and governors from these districts tend to support redistributive presidents and be weaker political challengers than governors from richer units. In contrast, weaker presidents are less capable of resisting pressures from governors from larger and richer districts. There is also more distribution to developing regions when presidents have a larger share of partisan allies there and fewer in richer states. The article discusses these results, compares them with competitive claims, and explores implications for the comparative debate. © 2016 The Author.},

We argue that the interaction between preferences of state-wide and non-statewide parties, their negotiation power and the negotiation mode accounts for specific patterns of territorial change. Analytically, we advance existing research in two ways: First, by analyzing territorial change in a two-dimensional space (vertical and horizontal), we pay explicit attention to jurisdictional heterogeneity between substates. Second, by applying an actor-centered institutionalist approach, we highlight the strategic potential of actors within the institutional setting. The comparative analysis of thirteen processes of territorial change in four multinational Western democracies-Canada, Belgium, Spain, and the UK-reveals, first, certain conditional effects of the independent variables on specific patterns of territorial change and, second, how the negotiation mode impacts on a party's negotiation power. © 2015 The Author.},

Second, we examine whether the Linz-Moreno question also captures identity intensity. Third, we focus on the middle-identity category and examine whether it encapsulates people's dual sense of belonging where there are two different national identities. Using data from the Making Electoral Democracy Work Project for the Spanish/Catalan case, we show that the Linz-Moreno question meets the assumptions of linearity, intensity, and the meaning of the role of the central category when capturing Catalan identity feelings. However, it fails to capture Spanish identity intensity and preferences, which over-represents the dual-identity middle category.

The results suggest that petitions are more likely to be granted as the preference heterogeneity among members of amicus coalitions increases.

On the contrary, they nationalize regional elections (i.e., emphasize national-level issues in regional campaigns) as an electoral strategy to win votes. The empirical evidence comes from the quantitative content analysis of regional-level manifestos of the two main national parties in Spain, PP, and PSOE, between 1998 and 2015. The percentage of references to the national government is taken as an indicator of nationalization. We find that parties nationalize regional elections under two situations: when the national co-partisans are in office enjoying high levels of popularity or when the national co-partisans are in opposition and the nationally governing party is unpopular. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of national parties in subordinating the regional arena to the national one in federal and decentralized states. © The Author 2016.},

Sometimes, however, federal interventions actually can prevent states from adopting sound policy innovations. U.S. states struggle to adopt rapid wetland assessment tools because of contradictory pressures exerted on states by two federal agencies locked in protracted conflict. This tension creates opportunities for states to influence federal policy and leads each federal agency to try to use states as instruments for imposing its priorities on the other. When analyzing the conditions under which cooperative federalism does not achieve its intended purposes, scholars should attend to horizontal intergovernmental complexity and the realities of policy implementation. © 2014 © The Author 2015.

Yet, little consensus exists about how effective local public welfare expenditures are at reducing local poverty: local governments can offer policies more responsive to local needs, but may also face a welfare migration effect. I argue that the effectiveness of local public welfare policy at poverty reduction is a function of interjurisdictional and intergovernmental arrangements. Analyzing data from the 1997 to 2007 Census of Governments, I find that the magnitude of the marginal effect of local public welfare expenditures on poverty is smaller in jurisdictionally fragmented regions than in consolidated regions. In addition, the magnitude of the marginal effect of local public welfare spending is greater following implementation of welfare reform in states that devolved authority to the local level than in states that did not. © 2015 © The Author 2015.

We hypothesize that the extent to which cost-shifting takes place in a multitiered welfare state depends on the degree of fiscal centralization, and we expect cost-shifting to be more prevalent in federal countries where the constituent units have strong fiscal autonomy. In order to empirically examine this claim, we compare Germany and Switzerland, two federal countries that differ considerably in matters of fiscal centralization. Empirically, we find that in fact cost-shifting occurred irrespective of the degree of fiscal centralization. However, there are differences in how the two countries reacted to cost-shifting practices. Fiscally centralized Germany has been more successful in limiting cost-shifting practices than decentralized Switzerland. By connecting the literature on social policy and fiscal federalism, the article contributes to a broader understanding of the functioning of multitiered welfare states. © 2016 The Author.},

Congressional gridlock, however, has frequently compelled the Obama Administration to turn to the tools of the administrative presidency to achieve its goals. While executive authority has enabled the President to pursue a relatively ambitious environmental agenda, it has often engendered conflict with Congress, industry, and some states. High levels of intergovernmental conflict have plagued the Obama Administration in several areas of environmental policy, including investment in renewable energy, Environmental Protection Agency regulations on air pollution, and executive actions to manage public lands. And, for their part, states have continued to pursue their own policy goals in the absence of federal policy, with episodes of both policy innovation and retrenchment. Although President Obama's approach continues a trend of presidents primarily using the tools of the administrative presidency, the President's signature climate change policy, the Clean Power Plan, may signal an evolving intergovernmental partnership in environmental policy. © 2016 The Author 2016.

In Canada, four provinces in particular, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, worked with each other and U.S. states, and engaged at the international level, when choosing policy instruments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. How did inter-jurisdictional dynamics influence the instruments these provinces selected and has there been convergence in their policy responses? The article finds that policy transfer, information sharing, and emulation among jurisdictions, was more likely to overcome competitiveness concerns and lead to policy adoption when it was driven by technical learning or the desire to conform to external norms, than when jurisdictions compared themselves to others or attempted to influence broader policies through political benchmarking and bandwagoning. Despite continued variation in some areas, there has been limited convergence on some provincial instruments. © The Author 2017.

Drawing upon Daniel Elazar's enduring typology of American political subcultures and using a new news-based measure of corruption issues, we find that political culture remains a "sticky" deep determinant of the distribution of corruption issues across states. Unlike previous empirical studies we do not treat political culture as a set of consensus values, but rather emphasize tensions that can arise when multiple political cultures coexist in a state. Our findings are of interest not only with respect to the enduring role of culture itself, but also in terms of how it might help us understand the growing number of actions that are legal, yet still seen by many as corrupt. © The Author 2016.},

More precisely, it argues that the incentives and the risks associated with a division of responsibilities among different jurisdictions may constitute an obstacle to broad reforms that promote labor market participation of nonworking benefit recipients. This argument is illustrated with a case study discussing policy responses to a massive rise in caseloads among social assistance recipients in Switzerland. We conclude that the lack of a fundamental reform was the consequence of the incentives provided by the federal structure of the program. These incentives have both encouraged cost shifting among jurisdictions and discouraged involvement of federal level policy makers in a bigger reform. © © The Author 2014.

Reasons for the recent surge of state preemption laws are suggested, and the overall effectiveness of these laws is discussed. I conclude that rising conservative dominance of state legislatures has provided the opportunity to thwart progressive local policies, and these efforts have been aided by various industry and conservative organized groups. State preemption laws are not always successful in their aims. In some cases, state supreme courts have sided with local officials' claims of state overreach. In others, local officials have simply refused to comply. In any case, the threat of preemption may have a chilling effect on local policy innovation. © The Author 2017.},

Analyzing all orally argued Fourth Amendment cases from 1970 to 2009, we find the characteristics of the policy-making environment shape AG amicus activity. Initiation is predicted by institutional resources; whereas joining is the product of legal case facts and institutional resources. Because prior research notes larger attorney general coalitions are more successful, we highlight the complexity of amicus participation by state actors and speak to the conditions under which state actors can mobilize large coalitions to shape federal search and seizure case law. © 2015 The Author.},

The salience of territorial redistribution in the context of regional inequalities is likely to mobilize support for regional parties in national elections since territorial redistribution is decided at the national level. Thus, regional inequalities will favor the electoral success of regional parties in national-level elections. In this article we report evidence consistent with this argument based on an original data set that captures the electoral fate of regional parties in national contests across twenty-two OECD countries. Our results are robust to the use of different estimation methods as well as the consideration of the confounding influence of other factors which may affect the electoral fortunes of regional parties. © © The Author 2014.

Processes of hard and soft convergence and divergence operate in distinctive ways depending upon whether inputs, outcomes, processes, or institutions are considered. Hard convergence arguments are most convincing in terms of inputs (referring to pressures of international ranking and rating, tougher European Union budgetary rules, enhanced central steering and tighter controls on public expenditure).

Increasingly, red and blue states have taken different trajectories in implementing Obama Administration policies, with resistance from many conservative state leaders and enthusiasm from Democrats. To manage these challenges, the Administration has turned to an array of old and new tools for accommodating territorial variations in politics and policy: opt outs for reluctant or resistant states, accommodation for states that wish to go beyond federal standards, aggressive use of waivers, and so forth. This "variable speed federalism" model - marked by increasingly diverse patterns of state implementation of national policies - has been the paradoxical outgrowth of what President Obama once hoped would become a "new nationalism." This article explores these themes in more detail, briefly recapping the principal domestic accomplishments of the Obama Administration, examining emerging patterns of intergovernmental relations, and discussing the increased federal tolerance of state diversity in federal intergovernmental programs. © 2016 The Author 2016.

This article assesses these questions through a strategic comparison of resource federalism in Canada and Australia since the 1970s. We argue that the political and institutional strategies employed within the Canadian federation, with its greater commitment to fiscal and political decentralization, has been more adept at managing short term political tensions associated with resource booms relative to the Australian model, with its creeping centrism and entrenched system of horizontal equalization. The study also finds that, over time, resource conflict has the potential to shape the practice of federalism in resource-rich jurisdictions by providing political incentives to decentralize nonrenewable resource revenue collection. © 2014 The Author.

This discretion influences the expenditure, and potentially the impact, of many billions of dollars every year. Unfortunately, we know very little about the decisions states make regarding the volume of federal grant aid they pass through, or about the types of subrecipients most likely to receive that money. Drawing on delegation theory, this study develops the argument that the amount and target of pass-through funding will be a function of the state's capacity to produce desired goods, shared policy preferences between state and local actors, and the relative capacity of substate actors to produce those same goods.We test these hypotheses in analyses of the pass-through of ARRA grants to subrecipients by state governments between 2009 and 2012. The results from those analyses suggest that delegation theory provides a useful way to understand both the volume of pass-through that states engage in as well as the target of those monies. © The Author 2015.},

A preliminary, fieldwork-based test of the theory in Mozambique provides support for the first three of our arguments. If these effects appear in other cases, they have the potential to transform our understanding of how decentralization influences political outcomes, showing that its potential impact extends far beyond the local level. © The Author 2016.},

	abstract = {Many countries, especially in Africa, have increased their subnational administrative units in recent years. Researchers point to marginalized ethnic groups as a key force behind administrative subdivision. This article seeks to disentangle the relative influence of elites and the masses in prompting two movements for new administrative units in Nigeria (for Bayelsa and Ekiti states). I find that elites generated the movements, but not simply by mobilizing co-ethnics around an enduring identity. Rather, political entrepreneurs reconfigured ethnic boundaries and infused latent identities with new significance. They found ethnic appeals to be expedient for political mobilization. This finding cautions against interpreting ethnic mobilization for new districts as cultural groundswells. Overall, this article contributes to the emerging debate over the sources of demand for new administrative units in the developing world. © 2016 The Author.},

	abstract = {This article examines individual preferences toward the vertical distribution of authority in Brazil by means of a representative national survey. We propose an original methodology to tackle two challenges the current literature faces: the effects of multipolarity over voters' preferences and the conflation of two concepts - "wishes for change" and "preferences over the architecture of the state - both concerning attitudes toward the vertical distribution of authority. We test various theories concerning the importance of territorial identity, socio-demographic factors, and geography of income in determining individual preferences regarding vertical distribution of authority. We find that in Brazil territorial identity does not play a role in determining preferences, whereas socioeconomic status and within-regions inequality do matter, suggesting that Brazil is a type of federation where a dual identity (belonging to one's region and the national state) prevails as well as within- and cross-region inequality. © 2015 The Author.},

We examine individual participation in regional elections in Canada, Spain, and the United Kingdom and make three arguments: (i) standard models of turnout devised for national contests only partly explain regional turnout, with the personal characteristics of voters more important than contextual variables; (ii) territorial identity and the level of jurisdictional authority wielded by the regional legislature are important determinants of electors' willingness to participate in regional elections; (iii) when we contrast subjective perception and objective/aggregate findings we see that regional legislative authority matters more than perceived salience, and individual regional identity matters more than the views of fellow citizens, but that these effects are largely conditional on age. © 2014 The Author.

	abstract = {Since 1989, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have experienced major institutional transformations. As part of that process, territorial contestations between states and ethnic minorities engendered three outcomes: negotiated territorial self-government (TSG) arrangements; the denial of such arrangements; and the emergence of de-facto states. Through a qualitative comparative analysis of twenty-four minorityTSG claims in seventeen post-communist CEE states, we find that: (i) TSG arrangements emerged as externally facilitated instruments for managing or preventing violent conflict in predominantly low-capacity, only partially democratic states; (ii) peacefully pursued TSG claims were most likely to be denied in high-capacity consolidated democracies; and (iii) de-facto states emerged where patron-states intervened in violent conflicts in low-capacity states. These findings defy widely held expectations about the influence of Europeanization, coupled with democratic consolidation, on the accommodation of minority claims; and they offer new insights into the significance of external intervention for the institutional outcomes of ethnic minorityTSG claims. © The Author 2017.

	abstract = {Past comparative research has argued that presidential systems may impose a constraint on parties' ambitions in the presence of presidential coattails: if a party intends to become a large national organization, then it must be able to effectively compete for the presidency. In this article, we argue that this is not necessarily the case in multilevel presidential countries. Some parties, in fact, nationalize through "presidentialization," tying the party's fortunes in lower level elections to presidential candidates'performance. However, in the absence of a competitive presidential candidate, adapting to local electoral markets to maximize performance in gubernatorial races across a wide number of provinces may be the most effective path to nationalization.We rely on statistical analyses of party strategies in two presidential countries with strong federal institutionsç Brazil and Argentinaçto show that parties in multilevel presidential countries can pursue distinct but equally effective paths to nationalization. © The Author 2017.
