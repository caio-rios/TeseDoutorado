abstract={Despite growing evidence of pro-female bias in the electorate elsewhere, conventional wisdom holds that voters in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) prefer male candidates, presumably due to sexism. We test this conventional wisdom using a conjoint experiment administered to over 30,000 respondents in six MENA countries. We find both male and female respondents are more likely to express support for female candidates and see them as more capable than their male counterparts, even in stereotypically male domains. We argue the increasing demand for political outsiders explains these results. In highlighting the importance of such changes, our study expands the application of gender congruity theory in the MENA and beyond by offering evidence that both changes in gender stereotypes (i.e., gender roles) and in what citizens desire in leaders (i.e., leader roles) reduce anti-female bias at the polls. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={How does the salience of clientelism in politics impact voter support for women legislative candidates? Existing research finds little bias against women legislative candidates in survey experiments. Where bias exists, it is due to “role congruity,” where voters penalize women because of a perceived lack of specific traits or issue preferences suitable for the position. Building on existing work, I theorize that the ability to deliver patronage is a “role” voters might find stereotypically incongruous with women. Using two waves of a nationally representative survey in Vietnam, I generate preregistered predictions about the impact of a clientelism prime on bias against women legislative candidates. I then test the prediction, with results showing that when clientelism is primed, bias against women candidates increases. These results provide evidence that clientelism has gendered effects on political representation. It also theorizes an additional “role” that could penalize women at the polls. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={Europeans, on average, are distrustful toward representative institutions. In recent decades, to restore confidence in political institutions, several countries have implemented alternative decision-making processes. The literature has analyzed preferences for these alternatives, such as direct democracy or technocracy, and their drivers. However, these analyses often treated these preferences in isolation, without considering that citizens might have more complex preferences involving multiple actors in the decision-making process. We test whether this complexity exists in a novel survey experiment where citizens are exposed to two different vignettes about divisive policies in Italy. Our results indicate that, more than anything else, Italian citizens prefer having their fellow citizens decide alone in referendums. However, they also favor consulting experts before Parliament's decision. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while instrumentality is still crucial in evaluating the fairness of the processes, certain decision-making processes make losers of the policy outcome as satisfied as specific groups winners. These findings hold significant implications for citizens' policy evaluations, highlighting that the decision-making process might influence their overall satisfaction with policies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.},

abstract={Existing research on the effects of women’s descriptive representation on citizens’ attitudes has mainly investigated potential positive effects, namely on political engagement or the legitimacy of outcomes. However, trends in representation have rarely been theorized as potential causes of resentment among women. While a male backlash to increasing representation has been theorized, this article argues that women may also be discontent with their trajectory of representation, if they perceive it as stagnating. Using a survey experiment fielded in Germany, the results show that a stagnating representation trajectory mobilizes women to vote for a progressive party, the German Greens. In contrast, the paper demonstrates that men do not lash back against women’s increasing representation, even if they realize that this means a lower standing for themselves. This article contributes to research on political behavior by highlighting that discontent with persisting inequality is a mobilizing factor for progressive parties. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={What explains ethnic minorities’ attachment to the state? Our current understanding has primarily considered structural factors, particularly access to political power and modernization. Diverging from existing explanations, I theorize that mundane experiences with the state, in street-level bureaucracy, can inform ethnic minorities’ attitudes toward the state. What they see and experience in street-level bureaucracy signals to ethnic minorities what their prospects might be in a country that is politically dominated by another ethnic group. Leveraging extensive fieldwork in Myanmar, I show that ethnic minorities who have had positive encounters with street-level bureaucrats express stronger attachment to the state. This is the case even when an ethnic group is in direct conflict with the state. I also find that service experiences are more relevant in explaining ethnic minorities’ attachment to the state compared to factors highlighted in existing research. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={What explains citizen support for executive aggrandizement? Previous work points to support for the president, showing that individuals who support the incumbent are more accepting of executive aggrandizement. Yet, the role of the president in shaping support for (and the meaning of) executive aggrandizement is unexplored. I argue that populist discourse increases support for executive aggrandizement by framing the president as the genuine representative of the people and by portraying institutional opposition as corrupt. Two studies support this argument: First, a multilevel analysis shows that a text-based measure of populist discourse is associated with increasing support for the president closing congress or the supreme court. The estimated effect of populist discourse is largest among presidential supporters. Second, a survey experiment conducted in Ecuador shows that populist and anti-elitist discourse increase support for a hypothetical executive closing the legislature. The findings indicate that populist discourse undermines public opinion as an executive accountability mechanism. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={Does election fraud erode support for dictators? An original survey experiment from Russia following the 2020 vote on constitutional amendments reveals three key findings. First, regime supporters and opponents differ significantly in their baseline beliefs about election fairness. While regime opponents are already aware of fraud, supporters expect relatively fair elections. Consequently, only regime supporters revise their election beliefs when exposed to fraud information. Second, fraud revelations reduce regime legitimacy beliefs, but only among the regime’s political base. In contrast, regime opponents already perceive the regime as illegitimate at the baseline. Third, the experiment shows minimal, if any, effects on attitudes toward Putin. While fraud revelations cause regime supporters to adjust their views on the regime, their opinions about Putin remain largely unaffected. The findings imply that dictators can maintain popular support among their political base while manipulating elections, posing questions about the potential of fraud to undermine regime stability. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={Traditional leaders can influence electoral outcomes. We designed an experiment to investigate why public endorsements by chiefs affect voters—and which types of voters they influence. Chiefs have incentives to prefer politicians who will promote local development, and can use endorsements to sway elections accordingly. We argue that voters often interpret chiefs’ endorsements as a signal of candidate quality. To assess this argument, we exposed voters to real endorsements made by chiefs during Ghana’s 2020 presidential election. We show that endorsements impact the vote choice of undecided voters. Consistent with a signaling mechanism, respondents exposed to chiefs’ rationale for endorsing a candidate were no more likely to vote for the endorsed candidate than those who only heard chiefs’ approval of a candidate. Further, treated respondents hold higher evaluations of the endorsed candidate on multiple dimensions of candidate quality. Our results suggest that chiefs influence voters through a non-coercive mechanism, which has positive implications for accountability. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={In this experiment, we manipulate corporate political connections to assess whether a company’s political influence serves as a barrier or an inducement to investment. We utilize survey data from 3329 firm employees and managers across Venezuela, Ukraine, and Egypt. Overall, our findings suggest that respondents generally prefer not to invest in companies with political connections. Interestingly, this aversion is conditional on the respondent’s company’s own level of political connection: individuals from highly connected companies do not penalize connected companies as investment choices. In contrast, those from less-connected companies are inclined to invest in companies without political connections. We theorize that this pattern is rooted in differences in how companies with varying levels of connections manage liabilities. Our data reveal that connected companies are more likely to employ informal, rather than formal, mechanisms to resolve disputes. We argue that unconnected investors likely prefer investing in unconnected companies to better ensure that their property rights are safeguarded. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={Several nations have enacted gender reforms in policing, many of which are premised on the notion that women favor female officers, especially in the context of tackling violence against women (VAW). We investigate this topic in India. Evidence from the first nationally representative survey on policing (N ≈ 15,000) demonstrates high levels of bias against policewomen, including among women and VAW complainants. To estimate the causal effect of police gender on officer evaluations, we design an unusual video experiment with assistance from the news corporation New Delhi Television (N ≈ 1000). We find that policewomen are not generally preferred to policemen, and citizens have significantly unfavorable attitudes toward female officers when seen tackling VAW rather than non-VAW cases. These negative ratings are driven by female respondents. We highlight certain context-specific explanations and note that the manner in which policewomen are typecast may undercut the positive implications associated with representation. Our study is an example of shared identity increasing mistrust, and it expands the discussion about citizens using ascriptive characteristics to make inferences about politicians to include front-line bureaucrats like police officers. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={IMF interventions are often associated with rising political discontent in countries where the Fund intervenes. Studies examining this relationship, however, face the challenge of disentangling the impact of the IMF from the impact of the crisis that triggered the intervention. To address this challenge, we conduct survey experiments in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain and directly assess how voters evaluate the costs and benefits of an IMF intervention. We find that voters believe that the crisis will more likely be solved when the IMF intervenes, but they are also critical of the corresponding loss of national sovereignty. Because the former consideration, on average, dominates their assessment, IMF interventions increase the support of voters for unpopular economic policies. Nonetheless, cross-country differences suggest that continued public support for intervention hinges on the IMF’s ability to deliver on its promise to help resolve the crisis. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={How does emigration affect tax preferences in migrant-sending countries? Experiencing public services in a high tax-capacity destination may reduce support for tax increases by throwing fiscal failure at home into stark relief (the socialization hypothesis). Alternatively, migrants’ exclusion from certain public services may increase desire to fund these services in migrant origin countries (the exclusion hypothesis). We test these competing hypotheses with an online survey experiment in Mexico and explore variation in US healthcare access on fiscal policy preferences of migrant households. Migrant households, especially those with returned migrant members, are more supportive of taxation when tax revenue is earmarked for healthcare, a service to which many Mexican immigrants in the US lack access. It is migrants’ exclusion from, rather than their socialization into, the fiscal contract in destination countries that influences fiscal policy preferences in their countries of origin. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on everyday life, where people feel affected both economically and health-wise by the spread of the novel virus, regardless of whether they have contracted it or not. At the same time, we know that populist attitudes influence how people perceive their individual situation, the political environment, and available policy solutions. Are these two factors interrelated? This article examines the role that populist attitudes play (a) in subjective feelings of being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) in choosing policies to counteract its spread. Populist attitudes may lead people to reject the policy-making process during the COVID-19 pandemic, shaped primarily by experts. The article argues that this should increase the sense of concern among people with populist orientations and lead to a rejection of commonly discussed policies to contain the virus. To test this connection empirically, we conducted a representative survey in Austria in September 2020. Our analysis shows a significant and substantive correlation between populist attitudes and the subjective feeling of being affected by the crisis in the areas of health and the economy. Similarly, we find evidence that populist attitudes affect the acceptability of policies to combat the spread of COVID-19. These findings indicate that populist attitudes have such strong effects on individuals’ perception of the world that they even influence the perception of the globally shared challenge of a pandemic. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={Scholars and policymakers widely view identity as a key driver of African citizens’ political engagement. In doing so, however, they have emphasized ethnicity and largely sidelined other identities, including gender, local origin, shared residency, and partisanship. In this paper, we explore which identities drive political engagement and why they do so. We employ an original survey experiment that includes various identities and other incentives that may drive citizens’ participation around Zambia’s 2021 national elections. We find that partisanship most influences individuals’ stated willingness to campaign for a candidate or meet with an MP, while ethnicity and social incentives play less significant roles. Finally, we explore the mechanisms underpinning these results and find that citizens anticipate sanctions if they fail to support a co-partisan but not a co-ethnic candidate. These findings have important implications for understanding political engagement and democratic development throughout the region. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={What explains variation in neighborhood problem-solving? We argue that collective action infrastructure—place-based connections, organizations, knowledge, and practices formed while organizing—can reduce the costs of local collective action, even in communities without preexisting social and civic organizations. We adapt theories from the social movements literature about mobilizing structures and personal networks to the neighborhood context and propose that, even absent preexisting structures, an initial act of organizing in the face of a salient problem can itself facilitate future organizing. In contrast to expectations that local organizations will disband quickly upon achieving their initial goal, we argue that, because neighborhood problem-solving involves fixed costs and overlapping constituencies, local organizing infrastructure is often repurposable across issue areas. Observational data, a natural experiment, and a survey experiment from an online survey of residents across Mexico City demonstrate these downstream effects of organizing, even across unrelated issues. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={While there is a large literature studying the determinants of public support for European integration, we know much less about the factors shaping attitudes towards various international cooperation initiatives. In this article, we study the possible influence of framing, a mechanism linking pre-existing values and causal beliefs, on preferences for cooperation with the EU. We develop six thematic frames related to the context of international cooperation: economic benefits, security, shared identity, traditional and liberal values, and rules and norms of governance. We test the effects of these frames using a survey experiment conducted in three countries in Eastern Europe—Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine—that are targeted by the integration projects of both the EU and Russia. We find that thematic framing has only small effects on international cooperation preferences: priming liberal values and governance increases slightly support for cooperation with the EU, but the effects of the remaining frames are too small and heterogeneous to be estimated precisely with our sample. Contrary to expectations, some of these effects are exercised by changing the relevant causal beliefs of citizens, even if the thematic frames were not designed to do so. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2023.},

abstract={The European Union has sought to democratise its post-communist neighbours for the past three decades, starting with Central and Eastern Europe after 1989. Since the end of the wars in Former Yugoslavia in 2000, the EU first pursued closer integration with the Western Balkans followed by the goal of enlargement. However, despite intensive EU involvement, the fight against corruption has stagnated or deteriorated in post-communist Europe, particularly in Former Yugoslavia. The central question in the article is whether indirect EU influence has led municipal officials—who are at the front line of vital distributive decision-making for citizens at the local level—to imitate (or emulate) attitudes related to corruption and to informality in line with EU norms. The article focuses on the case of Serbia, where anti-corruption progress has been particularly slow. Using a survey of Serbian municipal officials, the article examines whether indirect EU influence via involvement in policy implementation affected attitudes towards informal payments, and through a vignette-based survey experiment, whether those involved in EU-compliant policy implementation are less accepting of local political elite corruption. © Springer Nature Limited 2023.},

abstract={Many protesters under authoritarian rule are “narrow in scope, involving only one or a few neighborhoods, villages, or groups of laid-off workers” and focus on demands that “have to do only with material interests and local grievances” (Lorentzen, 2013, p. 131). These protests typically blame local authorities and express loyalty to the political system. However, in the internet age, pro-democracy advocates often endorse and co-opt these local policy protests for their own ends. Does being endorsed by pro-democracy activists undermine support for these local policy protesters? Building on research suggesting that non-activists often perceive activists as extreme, I theorize that associating with pro-democratic frames can undermine support for local policy protesters by making the protesters seem more extreme and their protests less legal. Using an internet survey experiment in Vietnam, I find support for my argument. These findings highlight a challenge to building pro-democracy coalitions under authoritarian rule. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={Candidate debates are increasingly organized during elections in democracies and electoral autocracies. How do debates impact partisan divisions and preferences in these contexts? One theoretical perspective suggests that debates should amplify these preferences and divisions, while another implies debates should attenuate them. This paper evaluates these expectations by studying presidential debates organized during Malawi’s May 2019 elections. With an experiment and national panel survey, the paper provides evidence consistent with attenuation: debate watchers were substantially more likely to vote across partisan lines (cross-party voting), became more favorable toward out-partisan candidates, and became less favorable toward co-partisans. Suggestive evidence on causal mechanisms shows that these effects were driven by policy persuasion and debates’ impact on perceptions of the candidates’ policies and qualities. Results advance debates about information processing, campaign effects, and voting behavior in new democracies and electoral autocracies, and have implications for electoral institutions’ impact on partisan divisions. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={Scholars commonly link citizens’ broader ideological views to their preferences for two opposing approaches to fighting crime: conservatives are believed to support punitive approaches, while progressives support preventative solutions. Yet, other studies indicate that citizens across the ideological spectrum support punitive approaches, often due to instrumental factors such as experiences with and perceptions of crime. This study examines how instrumental factors interact with ideology and determines under what circumstances progressives support punitive candidates. The results of a conjoint experiment fielded in Argentina and Brazil demonstrate that among progressives, the effect of ideology on preferences for punitive candidates is moderated by three instrumental factors: perceptions regarding 1) insecurity, 2) the ineffectiveness of social policy, and 3) gang-driven crime; there are null results regarding the role of victimization. The findings also provide evidence that conservatives prefer punitive candidates regardless of instrumental explanations. The results are validated through an analysis of AmericasBarometer data. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={Citizens in multiple crime-ridden countries strongly support the militarization of security—that is, placing the military in charge of traditional policing duties. Yet, we know little about the determinants of such support. Do people approve of militarization even in the face of human fatalities? We explore this question in the context of Mexico’s “war on drugs.” In three experimental studies, we manipulate the presence of human costs in a military operation against a drug lord and present arguments either justifying or condemning these costs. We consistently find that, even in successful operations, support for militarization decreases when military operations cause civilian casualties, but not when the victims are members of drug cartels. This finding holds for both respondents who have been victims of cartel-related violence and those who have not. Arguments that justify these costs as helping to achieve the end goal of eradicating organized crime increase support. These findings shed light on the public opinion side of the militarization of security debate, and have important implications for security policy reform and democratic politics. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={City residents in the Global South commonly encounter the police. Yet, outside of established democracies, we know little about how ethnicity shapes everyday policing in diverse urban contexts. Existing approaches generate competing expectations, with some arguing that officers are more rather than less discriminatory towards coethnics. We test these theories through a survey experiment conducted in Karachi, Pakistan—one of the world’s largest megacities. We find that civilians are only marginally less likely to expect procedural justice from non-coethnic officers, even in a context where ethnicity is highly salient. However, suggestive evidence indicates that this small effect is significantly magnified for respondents who perceive their group to be underrepresented in the police. Descriptive representation is therefore a powerful moderator of the relationship between ethnicity and expectations of police bias. These results have implications for the development of effective and legitimate police institutions in weakly institutionalized contexts. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={In this article, we examine the demand-and-supply dynamic of security policies. We argue there are two informational shortcuts through which voters process policy alternatives and choose among them: (1) their own personal experiences with violence and (2) candidates’ profiles. We test our argument through an original survey experiment conducted in Mexico. We model voters’ decisions to support candidates campaigning over a variety of security proposals. Our survey design takes advantage of recent developments in network models to better measure the effects of crime exposure on voters’ preferences. We find that higher exposure to crime victimization is associated with increased support for only some iron-fist policies, therefore highlighting the importance of unpacking security policies instead of generalizing the results of crime exposure. We show null effects of partisan advantages and reveal the role of non-partisan heuristics, such as the candidate’s professional experience, in preferences for security policies. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={What motivates private firms’ willingness to invest in green technologies and environmentally friendly operations? Some emphasize enhanced government regulation and enforcement, while others point to the greater potential of societal pressure. In this study, we use a survey experiment with more than 10,000 firms in Vietnam to test which type of stakeholder pressure has the strongest impact on domestic and foreign business leaders’ intention to invest in green operations. We find that the effectiveness of stakeholder pressure is conditioned by the firms’ target markets. Foreign investors are more susceptible than domestic firms to intensive regulatory pressure. Accounting for export orientation, however, we find that the most amenable policy targets for regulatory pressure are foreign firms aiming to sell in the Vietnamese domestic market. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={How do violent elections affect the willingness of citizens to defend democratic institutions? We argue that in the wake of violent elections, support for democratic constraints on the executive will diverge amongst ruling and opposition party supporters. To protect their position, ruling party supporters become more likely to endorse weakening constraints on executive power, even if it violates democratic principles. Opposition supporters, on the other hand, become more likely to reject democratic transgressions that de facto render them more vulnerable to political abuse. We examine these expectations using a vignette experiment embedded in a nationally representative 2019 post-election survey of 2400 Nigerians. Our findings suggest that incumbent supporters are overall more likely to endorse weaker constraints on the executive, but these attitudes are not reinforced by information about election violence. Opposition supporters, in contrast, become less likely to accept transgressions when informed about election violence. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={Immigration is an extremely divisive political issue in Western Europe and North America. We examine whether immigration policy preferences are more nuanced than commonly understood. Too often, analyses of immigration policy preferences only consider the number of people allowed into the country. Yet, immigration policy must also address which people are allowed into the country and what rights they can have. We present results from a series of original surveys conducted in Germany between April 2020 and August 2022. We find preferences about policies governing immigration flows are conditional on policies governing entrance criteria and rights eligibility. Respondents who oppose immigration in general are willing to compromise and allow more immigration if entrance criteria become more selective. Respondents who support immigration are willing to compromise and accept less immigration if rights become more generous. Our findings have implications for understanding divides over immigration as well as policy debates more generally. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={How does intergroup inequality, specifically minority experiences of persecution, affect contributions to local public goods? Based on an original survey experiment and qualitative research in slums in Delhi, we examine how Hindus and Muslims respond to social norms around promoting cooperation on community sanitation. Mainstream theories of development predict greater willingness to contribute to public goods in more homogeneous areas. In contrast to the “diversity-deficit hypothesis,” however, we find that social accountability mechanisms are more effective among Muslims, a group that routinely faces discrimination and violence in India. We propose that this reflects “defensive cooperation,” or a set of coping strategies developed by minorities to navigate a hostile sociopolitical environment. Our findings point to a new mechanism that helps to enforce prosocial norms and, hence, public goods provision in multiethnic contexts. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected boundaries of solidarity? Human-induced crises that impose asymmetric costs tend to sharpen pre-existing divides, but natural disasters often strengthen solidarity. The pandemic possesses properties of both kinds of crisis. In a panel survey conducted in Northern Italy, the initial epicenter of the pandemic, we asked respondents to complete conjoint tasks querying who was likely to violate health guidelines (wave 1) and who should be prioritized for vaccine distribution (wave 2). We find that while discrimination towards the rich is nearly universal, bias against other outgroups depends on ideology and personal experience with the crisis. Leftwing individuals display discrimination towards partisan outgroups, while those on the right display ethnic bias. However, this effect is conditional: those who suffered a significant income loss but no health effects display heightened discrimination, while respondents who experienced COVID-19 as a personal health crisis are less likely to penalize outgroups. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={We evaluate whether feelings of state pride in the USA are linked to the quality of democracy in one's state. Using two original surveys, we find no relationship between an objective measure of the quality of state democracy and feelings of state pride. In contrast, we find a consistent positive relationship between subjective evaluations and state pride such that citizens with more positive evaluations of the quality of democracy in their state report higher levels of state pride. Interestingly, feelings of state pride are not linked to the objective measure of democracy even when citizens are informed of where their state ranks in a survey experiment. However, subsample analyses reveal that there is a relationship between the objective measure and state pride among Democrats and political "losers"(citizens living in states where the government is controlled by the opposite party). We conclude by discussing implications for citizenship and state pride in an era of democratic erosion. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={Politicians, activists, and the rich themselves variously describe rich people as hard workers, greedy tax avoiders, generous philanthropists, and more. Occasionally, such descriptions are wielded in attempts to legitimize or delegitimize high income taxes on the rich. However, we do not have a good understanding of which of these appeals are most successful. This article explores which attributes of the rich affect support for progressive taxation. First, I use an inductive approach to derive relevant attributes from open-ended survey responses and prior literature. Then, pre-registered experiments in the United States and Denmark show that when the rich exhibit pro-social behaviors (e.g., treating workers well, not using tax loopholes), this reduces public support for taxing them. In comparison, indicators of merit (e.g., working hard) are of secondary or even insignificant importance. I conclude that in redistributive politics, the perceived pro-social behavior of the rich is a key consideration for the public. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={Lotteries could be a just and cost-effective procedure to distribute government benefits in contexts of oversubscription, with the added benefit of allowing assessments of the impact of government programs. However, little is known about whether there is public support for employing lotteries in this context. We examine support for a lottery that selects recipients of new government-built housing units in Brazil and find that neither lotteries participants nor the general public supports their use. We arrive at this result by employing a three-pronged multi-method approach. Quasi-experimental analysis of an original survey of lottery participants reveals that support not only is tepid, but substantially higher among winners than non-winners. In-depth interviews suggest that applicants believe lotteries miss the most deserving beneficiaries. A general population survey experiment reveals that lotteries are not perceived as just or efficient when compared to alternative beneficiary selection methods. While sometimes normatively desirable, the use of lotteries for government programs enjoys limited popular support. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={Penal policies have been the primary strategy of Latin American governments to combat crime, but preventative social policies such as youth education programmes may be more effective solutions. Penal and social policies are often treated as a trade-off by governments, who expect citizens—especially victims of violence—to be more supportive of punitive solutions. Using an original online survey experiment conducted in 2021 in Mexico, we challenge the idea of a trade-off between penal and social policies by studying how different policy solutions along the penal-welfare policy continuum affect victims’ support for increased state security presence. We unpack differences between victims of criminal perpetrators and state violence and those who are fearful of crime. Our vignette experiment reveals—in contrast to previous results—that crime victims are more supportive of state security presence when coupled with pre-emptive measures. Surprisingly, the same holds for victims of state violence and for those fearful of crime, including those residing in neighbourhoods with watch groups. Victimisation, by either crime or the state, raises demand for policies to increase employment and improve education. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={This study investigates why anti-democratic laws persist in democratic societies, focusing on South Korea's National Security Act (NSA). Enacted in 1948, the NSA restricts freedom of expression and movement to deter pro-North Korea behaviour. Despite being at odds with the tenets of liberal democracy, the act remains in place. Existing public opinion data indicates modest to strong support for the law, but measurement concerns leave much to be desired. Using a choice-based conjoint, we test the impact of democratic norms and national security rationales on various policy propositions related to the NSA, including its abolition. Results show widespread support for the Act, driven by both democratic norms and security concerns. Progressives are more likely to support revisions limiting the scope of the Act on the basis that it safeguards democracy, but they agree with conservatives that it should not be abolished. This research contributes to understanding South Korea's post-democratic transition and the balance between national security and democracy more broadly. © 2023 The Author(s).

abstract={Across the world, citizens sidestep the state to punish offenses on their own. Such vigilantism can help communities provide order, yet it raises concerns about public accountability and the rights of the accused. While prior research has identified the structural correlates of vigilantism, an open question is in which cases citizens prefer vigilantism over conventional policing. To make sense of these preferences, we draw on two logics of punishment: state substitution and retribution. Using survey data from a conjoint experiment presented to over 9000 households across Guatemala, we find that preferences for vigilantism depend on how transgressive the crime is as well as how unlikely it is to be prosecuted by the state. Victim and perpetrator gender, as well as crime severity and profession of the perpetrator, affect whether people endorse vigilante punishment. These results ultimately raise concerns about the viability of "informal" forms of policing. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={When studying the erosion of democratic institutions–such as elections–researchers often focus on elite co-optation or regime dynamics. Yet changes in political selection may also have long-term effects on the types of individuals seeking a political career, defining the dominant features of decision-makers down the road. I design a lab experiment to explore the effects of changes in political selection that accompanied authoritarian backsliding in Russia. Using a series of experiments, I show that creating an unfair playing field in elections and replacing elections with appointments for the local offices leads to self-selection of the risk-averse individuals into political careers. This happens because selection features like low costs of running (for regime candidates) and the absence of public evaluation for the appointees attract individuals who are more risk averse. This study demonstrates a causal mechanism connecting elements of authoritarian backsliding with citizen political ambition and contributes to our understanding of the long-term effects these changes may have on political participation, elite quality, and regime functioning. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Contrary to the conventional top-down view of government censorship, this study argues that ordinary citizens in authoritarian regimes frequently participate in censorship by reporting online content. I hypothesize that such participation in censorship partially explains the high level of public support for censorship found in existing surveys. Using an original survey in China, I demonstrate that participation in censorship is indeed prevalent, with over half of the respondents self-report having previously flagged online content, and that such participation is positively correlated with support for the censorship apparatus. To causally test the hypothesis, I conduct a pre-registered experiment using custom-engineered, simulated social media pages to manipulate reporting behavior. The results show that respondents encouraged to report simulated posts display significantly higher support for the censorship apparatus. This study highlights the role of ordinary citizens in facilitating authoritarian control and explains why repressive apparatus like censorship can be popular with the population. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={This paper highlights the overlooked role of prior grievances stemming from historical territorial loss as a significant factor behind support for nationalist populist parties. While not essential for the emergence of nationalist populism, territorial loss uniquely aligns with the backward-looking victimization framing crucial to these parties’ electoral success. Utilizing cross-national experimental and observational data from original surveys conducted in 2020–2021 in Romania, Hungary, Germany, and Turkey, we establish territorial loss attitudes as a robust predictor of nationalist populist party support. In addition to variations in national context, a trade-off emerges for governing populists, revealing that priming past losses attracts concerned voters but alienates those indifferent to territorial issues. Analyzing a quasi-natural experiment involving a new nationalist populist party that emerged in Romania between waves, we conclude that loss attitudes are stable over time and temporally prior to support for nationalist populism. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={Western actors are no longer the primary donors in developing countries. Authoritarian countries like China, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Russia are increasingly present in every low and middle-income country, competing for geopolitical influence. This paper seeks to understand how the characteristics of donor countries shape citizens’ approval of their local politicians and foreign donors. The article argues that transparency in the aid project affects citizens’ perceptions of corruption, while the donor’s regime—whether democratic or authoritarian—signals to citizens whether they can voice their criticism. I employ an experimental approach on a sample of 2500 respondents in Serbia, a middle-income country in Europe that receives substantial foreign assistance from both democratic and authoritarian donors. The paper contributes by discerning and testing key theoretical mechanisms related to donor attributes rather than the donor country. The results show that citizens like transparent donors the most because they are the least likely to make corruption worse. On the other hand, citizens perceive that cooperation with democratic donors will not improve local elites’ accountability toward citizens. Yet, cooperation with authoritarian donors will further deteriorate political elites’ responsiveness toward citizens. Cooperation with authoritarian donors can, thus, decrease support for local political elites. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

abstract={This article examines how public perceptions about the divide between blue and red states shape attitudes about secession in the United States. Through a nationally representative survey of the adult American population, I measure how individuals perceive political differences between states, and demonstrate that as perceptions of political differences increase, so too does support for secession. Measured through multiple questions and an experimental design, these findings demonstrate a previously underexplored dynamic of the country's partisan divisions. Both Democrats and Republicans are more likely to support secession as their awareness of the "red"and "blue"divide increasesçan attitude that is statistically independent from other beliefs that motivate partisan animosity in the contemporary United States, such as populism, racial resentment, affective polarization, and ideology.While talk of an impending "civil war"may be exaggerated, the widespread prevalence of secessionist beliefs shows that the legitimacy of the country's federal bargain is challenged by political nationalization. © TheAuthor(s) 2023.},

abstract={This study investigates factors influencing support for digital governance solutions and compares this support between autocracies and democracies. We conduct survey experiments in Russia, Germany, Turkey, the United States, and Estonia, and find that awareness of potential misuse of digital governance tools by the government reduces support. Importantly, while this effect has previously been documented for China, we find it irrespective of regime type for an autocracy, a hybrid regime and three democracies. Individuals relying on government-controlled information sources are more likely to endorse digital governance tools. Our study challenges prior findings by indicating that gaps in public service quality do not boost support. Instead, satisfaction with government services correlates with trust in the government’s capacity to implement digital governance solutions. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={Value conflict is at the heart of opposition to multiculturalism in Europe. Yet previous studies have not established which type of value conflict generates more anti-immigrant bias. We present a simple, cost-effective, and easily scalable experimental design to test how anti-immigrant bias responds to perceptions of value conflict generated by violations of welfare state norms and gender equity norms. Both types of norms are central to public debates about immigration in Europe. We collect new data from three European countries on natives’ beliefs regarding immigrants as likely violators of these norms, and we measure the salience of these norms in native society. We find that natives do not always sanction immigrants more for norm violations and their reactions to norm adherence or violations are consistent with a logic of “updating” for high-salience norms in countries where norm adherence is itself a norm. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={Can qualifications help candidates from historically marginalized groups win over out-group voters? We help answer this question with an original conjoint experiment fielded on a face-to-face survey conducted in three Afghan provinces between 2016 and 2017. The conjoint asked over 2,400 Afghan respondents to rank and choose between profiles of hypothetical candidates with varying gender, ethnic and educational attributes. We explore whether candidate qualifications – as measured by educational attainment – can amplify respondents’ support for hypothetical candidates from two social groups traditionally underrepresented in Afghan politics: women and Hazaras, a predominately Shi’a ethnic minority group. We find that higher qualifications consistently increase male (non-Hazara) respondents’ ranking and likelihood of choosing profiles with female (Hazara) candidates. These gains, however, do not completely offset male (non-Hazara) respondents’ in-group biases. Qualifications help but are not enough to dismantle voter preferences for in-group candidates. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={We examine a phenomenon we call “credit claiming by labeling” in which a sitting politician places her name on a project, program, or policy with the goal of claiming credit for it. While the prevalence of this practice suggests that many politicians believe that credit claiming by labeling will aid their careers, there is little existing evidence on this question. We examine the effects of credit claiming by labeling with a survey experiment in Argentina. We find that it has a negative, though small, effect on respondents’ attitudes. Descriptive data suggests that these results stem from the perceived pervasiveness of the practice. We then use evidence from an additional treatment on the (un)biased selection of program beneficiaries to show that respondents actually reward politicians who neither label nor manipulate programs. These results suggest substantial obstacles to overturning citizens’ negative baseline beliefs about the politicized implementation of government programs. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={A large literature documents Covid-19’s health and economic effects. We focus instead on its political impact and its potential to exacerbate identity divisions, in particular. Psychologists argue that contagious disease increases threat perceptions and provokes policing of group boundaries. We explore how insider-outsider status and symptoms of illness shape perceptions of infection, reported willingness to help, and desire to restrict free movement of an ailing neighbor using a phone-based survey experiment administered three times in two neighboring African countries during different stages of the pandemic: Malawi, from May 5 to June 2, 2020 (n = 4,641); Zambia, from July 2 to August 13, 2020 (n = 2,198); and Malawi again, from March 9 to May 1, 2021 (n = 4,356). We study identities that are salient in Malawi and Zambia but have not induced significant prior violence, making our study a relatively hard test of disease threat theories. We find that symptoms more strongly shape perceptions and projected behavior than insider-outsider status in both countries and across time, suggesting that there are limits to the ability of pandemics to independently provoke identity politics de novo. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={When and how do voters punish politicians for subverting democracy? To investigate the role of the public in democratic backsliding, I develop a conceptual framework that differentiates among three mechanisms: vote switching, backlash, and disengagement. The first mechanism entails defection by voters from a candidate who undermines democracy to one who does not; the latter two mechanisms entail transitions between voting and abstention. I estimate the magnitude of each mechanism by combining evidence from a series of original survey experiments, traditional surveys, and a quasi-experiment afforded by the rerun of the 2019 Istanbul mayoral election, in which the governing party, akp, attempted to overturn the result of an election that it had lost. I find that although vote switching and backlash contributed to the akp’s eventual defeat the most, each of the three mechanisms served as a democratic check in some subset of the Istanbul electorate. Persuasion, mobilization, and even demobilization are all viable tools for curbing the authoritarian tendencies of elected politicians. © 2023 Trustees of Princeton University.},

abstract={Authoritarian regimes in the 21st century have increasingly turned to using information control rather than kinetic force to respond to threats to their rule. This paper studies an often overlooked type of information control: strategic labeling and public statements by regime sources in response to protests. Labeling protesters as violent criminals may increase support for repression by signaling that protests are illegitimate and deviant. Regime sources, compared to more independent sources, could increase support for repression even more when paired with such an accusatory label. Accommodative labels should have opposing effects—decreasing support for repression. The argument is tested with a survey experiment in China which labels environmental protests. Accusatory labels increase support for repression of protests. Regime sources, meanwhile, have no advantage over non-governmental sources in shifting opinion. The findings suggest that negative labels de-legitimize protesters and legitimize repression while the sources matter less in this contentious authoritarian context. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={How do people respond to different decision-making processes in high courts? One long-standing view suggests that citizens expect courts to be neutral arbiters of legal controversies. Although the relevance of such “myth of legality” has been challenged, we know very little about the relationship between the portrayals of the motives of courts and justices and public attitudes in civil law countries. We explore this question in a pair of experiments in Norway and Portugal where we isolate the effects of different institutional frames from outcome favorability. We find that while partisan frames are detrimental to fairness perceptions and acceptance of decisions, depictions of judicial decision-making that emphasize policy goals do not adversely affect citizens’ responses in comparison with legalistic frames. The results suggest that, even in civil law systems, preserving the myth of legality may not be a necessary condition to elicit public support for judicial decisions. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={Punitive anti-crime policies in the Americas have contributed to steadily increasing rates of incarceration. Harsh penalties are often demanded by citizens, making them attractive to politicians. Yet the contextual determinants of participation in crime are rarely understood by the public. In this article, we employ a survey experiment conducted in Chile in order to examine how the provision of information about the prison population shapes tastes for punitive anti-crime policies. Respondents in the treatment group received information about the low educational attainment of prisoners. This information led to substantial changes in policy preferences. Tasked with allocating resources to anti-crime policies using a fixed budget, treated respondents assigned between 20% and 50% more to socially oriented anti-crime policies (relative to punitive policies) than respondents in the control group, and they reduced their support for “iron fist” policing. Our findings suggest that providing information to citizens might change the policy equilibrium in the Americas. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={What factors influence women’s political success in ethnically divided societies? Using an original survey experiment in the Indian state of Bihar, supplemented with qualitative interviews, we explore the impact of two factors—intersecting gender and caste identity, and the interaction of campaign appeal with voter experiences of caste discrimination—on women candidates’ success in state-level elections. We find, first, that women voters prefer women candidates, and that Scheduled Caste and Muslim voters also prefer candidates from their in-groups. At the same time, we identify evidence of intersectional effects, namely, that Muslim women candidates suffer from a disadvantage vis-a-vis women candidates from other backgrounds. We also show that women voters prefer candidates who offer security, especially when the candidates are women. Finally, we demonstrate that personal experience with caste discrimination increases support for women candidates. These results indicate that voters see women leaders as well-placed to ameliorate their security vulnerabilities. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Early and forced marriage (EFM) is an increasing focus of international organizations and local non-government organizations. This study assesses the extent to which attitudes and norms related to EFM can be changed by locally tailored media campaigns. A two-hour radio drama set in rural Tanzania was presented to Tanzanian villagers as part of a placebo-controlled experiment randomized at the village level. A random sample of 1200 villagers was interviewed at baseline and invited to a presentation of the radio drama, 83% of whom attended. 95% of baseline respondents were re-interviewed two weeks later, and 97% 15 months after that. The radio drama produced sizable and statistically significant effects on attitudes and perceived norms concerning forced marriage, which was the focus of the radio drama, as well as more general attitudes about gender equality. Fifteen months later, treatment effects diminished, but we continue to see evidence of EFM-related attitude change. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={After many decades and billions of dollars spent, the effects of foreign democracy promotion interventions remain poorly understood, particularly in authoritarian contexts. Do these external interventions contribute to the building blocks of democratization and democratic consolidation under autocracy? Do these potential contributions come at the cost of bolstering autocrats’ credibility? This article presents a randomized study of a democracy promotion program undertaken by a prominent international non-governmental organization (INGO) in rural Cambodia, in which elected parliamentarians from multiple political parties interacted with constituents. The intervention had relatively large effects on individuals’ knowledge about politics and self-reported political engagement but, crucially, did not give citizens increased confidence in Cambodia’s “democracy,” suggesting a role for democracy promotion without whitewashing the authoritarian nature of Cambodian politics. Overall, the results suggest that democracy promotion under authoritarianism can foster a more engaged and informed citizenry without lending undue credibility to an authoritarian system. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Tackling an important gap in the literature on political trust, this article focuses on politicians and the relevance of their other-to-self trust judgements for decision-making in public office. A unique quantitative dataset gathered from national politicians in the UK, Canada and South Africa is used to (1) examine descriptive levels of felt trust and distrust among politicians and (2) evaluate the impact of these feelings on politicians’ risky decision-making. To achieve outcome (2), this article presents the results of three survey experiments in which politicians were asked to make decisions in scenarios where both the presentation and the nature of risk varied. The results indicate that MPs’ perceptions of public trust and distrust do matter for risky decision-making, and that these variables moderate a reflection effect whereby MPs are otherwise more risk-averse in the face of gains and risk-taking in the face of losses. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Community policing, and citizen cooperation with law enforcement more broadly, can improve local security outcomes by providing decentralized mechanisms for police accountability to local citizens. We hypothesize that five factors—alignment of citizen/police interests, relative costs of cooperation, costs of crime, prevalence of others’ cooperation, and perceived police efficacy—comprise a decision framework that guides citizens’ choices regarding whether to share information with law enforcement. We find evidence for this framework using rich survey and survey experimental data from a large nation-wide survey of Guatemalans and municipal administrative data. Our results indicate that increasing police efficacy, witness protection, and neighborhood trust boost the odds of cooperation with police by up to 55%. At a time when conversations about the relationship between community and police are widespread, this research offers insights into conditions under which cooperation between community members and law enforcement is most likely to occur. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Scholars voice increasing interest in strategic ambiguity—a strategy whereby parties intentionally conceal their positions on divisive issues. Scholars contend that strategic ambiguity can help European parties broaden their electoral appeals. Although they identify several tactics and styles of position-blurring, the observational literature has yet failed to capture different variants of ambiguous rhetoric, let alone evaluate their effect on the vote. In this article, I rely on cross-country survey experiments that utilize representative samples of around 22,000 respondents from 14 European countries to evaluate the effect of four varieties of ambiguity: vagueness, ambivalence, flip-flopping, and negative messaging. I investigate the impact of ambiguous rhetoric vis-a-vis the context of competition facing the party. The findings reveal that the consequences of ambiguity vary by the actual form it takes and the context of competition facing the party. First, among the varieties, vague and ambivalent variants were superior to negative messaging or flip-flopping. Second, ambiguity helped the party in the absence of popular policy offers in the party system, while it backfired when competitors explicitly agreed with the voter. The findings imply that ambiguity is generally a useful strategy, but its benefits do not extend to rhetorical tactics that harm the party’s valence image. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Government services act as important sites of political socialization. Through interactions with the state individuals learn lessons about their value as citizens, form preferences over government services, and understand the value of political participation. What happens when the private sector replaces government provision of basic services? I explore this question in the context of a randomized private school voucher experiment in India. Based on an original household survey of 1200 households, and semi-structured interviews conducted 5 years after the voucher lottery, I find that voucher winning households hold stronger market-oriented beliefs. However, voucher winning households show little difference in political participation on most measures of political participation. I argue that these results are driven by a greater comfort with private providers as permanent economic actors. This suggests exposure to different economic actors, in the form of private schools, have the potential to change political preferences. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Many socially conservative settings oppose pro-LGBT+ advocacy because of its perceived threat to “traditional values.” Can messaging on these issues from sources considered to have similar values be more effective than messaging from sources considered to have different values? This research uses the move towards legal protection of certain LGBT+ rights in Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, and South Africa to understand whether signals of changing social norms from African sources are better able to shift perspectives of those elsewhere on the continent than primes from Western sources. Using a survey experiment conducted in Uganda, I show that neither one-off messaging from African sources nor one-off messaging from Western sources shifts beliefs or behavior on LGBT+ issues. Rather, these messages produce backlash to both African and Western sources. This work highlights the challenges of attempting to rapidly change perspectives on LGBT+ issues in the most socially conservative settings. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={New information technologies increasingly allow autocrats to shape public opinion outside their borders. Regimes like Russia and China spend millions on such efforts, raising concerns that they may be swaying foreign publics through their illiberal nationalist appeals. We know little, though, about the actual impact of such endeavors. We ask here: Where such regimes can find foreign audiences who support them and the values they represent, does this translate into an ability to sway public opinion on important foreign policy issues through their endorsements? We focus on the Putin regime’s ability to shape orientations toward US President Donald Trump’s foreign policy through an experiment-bearing survey in two countries that share EU aspirations but have different baseline orientations to the USA and Russia: Serbia and Albania. We first establish that Putin has a considerable number of sympathizers in both countries and that this sympathy is indeed linked to illiberal nationalist ideas. We show, however, that these sympathies do not translate into an ability to move public opinion, and that where pro-American priors are strong, illiberal nationalist endorsement can actually backfire. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Accepting defeat in political decision-making is crucial for the health of democracies. At the same time, being a good loser is challenging. How can citizens be motivated to be gracious about various types of political loss? In this paper, we study whether political leaders can play an important role in boosting the perceived quality of decision-making processes among losers in policy conflicts. We propose and test the impact of a simple intervention post-decision: good loser messages delivered by co-partisan leaders that remind citizens about the rules of the game. Three survey experiments on probability samples of the Norwegian and Swedish population (total n = 4700) show that good loser messages can indeed boost the process evaluations of policy losers. These findings emphasize the potential of procedural messaging to build loser’s consent between elections. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={We argue that tax policy typically does not respond to inequality because many voters hold equal treatment fairness beliefs for which the expectation is that, just as all have one vote, the state should treat citizens equally on other dimensions of policy. In the tax domain, this means all should pay the same rate. We propose a new survey instrument to measure equal treatment beliefs and implement it in surveys in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We document in all three countries a robust negative partial correlation between the strength of individual equal treatment beliefs and preferences for higher taxes on the rich. We also present results from a survey experiment in the United States that exposes respondents to a violation of equal treatment beliefs—voting weighted by educational attainment. Exposure to this treatment both increases the strength of equal treatment beliefs and decreases support for progressive taxation. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={An emerging consensus holds that nonviolent resistance campaigns are more successful than violent campaigns, partly because they attract more participants. Yet, we lack an understanding of whether and why nonviolent tactics attracts support. We propose two motivational logics that can explain support for nonviolence: An instrumentalist logic, whereby nonviolent resistance is preferred based on cost-benefit considerations, and an intrinsic logic where nonviolent resistance is preferred because of perceived inherent moral worth. To investigate the motivational pull of these two logics, we conduct a pre-registered survey experiment among more than 5000 respondents across 33 countries in fall 2019. We find that nonviolent tactics strongly increase movement support relative to violent tactics, and that the preference for nonviolence is primarily driven by intrinsic commitments to the moral worth of nonviolent resistance, rather than instrumental considerations. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={How do firms ensure secure exchange when the rule of law is weak and contracting institutions privilege the politically connected? In developing countries, firms may use social, formal, or political heuristics when selecting business partners, but how these factors jointly impact exchange remains understudied. In this article, I develop these theoretical mechanisms and test their impact with a conjoint experiment administered to 2389 formal and informal firms in Senegal. I find evidence in support of all three theories: To varying degrees, social, state, and political factors simultaneously impact firms’ sense of deal security and likelihood of exchange. The results demonstrate the substantial influence of formal predictors of exchange even in an overwhelmingly informal business environment, and also establish the countervailing effects of political connections on trade. These findings suggest that firms in developing countries must contend with an intricate political calculus to ensure their growth. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Prominent scholarship on foreign aid argues that aid can interfere with citizens’ ability to hold politicians accountable. One particular concern is that politicians receive undeserved credit for aid projects due to misattribution by voters with low information. But in some cases, politicians exert effort to ensure the success of projects and thus may deserve any credit they receive from voters. The authors show that the credit politicians receive depends both on voter information and on the capacity of politicians’ offices to provide oversight. Drawing on original surveys of politicians and nongovernmental organizations (ngos) in Uganda, the authors describe circumstances in which politicians support the realization and administration of aid projects. The authors then use an experiment to show that information about foreign financing and ngo implementation of these projects reduces support for incumbent politicians only when their offices have low aid oversight capacity. The authors also provide evidence from other African countries that shows that credit-giving for aid depends on both information and state capacity. Their results suggest that voters think realistically about what politicians might have contributed to aid projects and update their assessments accordingly. © 2023 Trustees of Princeton University.},

abstract={We examine whether disagreements about the Arab Spring uprisings, in five countries that experienced protests, have transitioned into the non-political sphere. To test this spillover effect, we ask two questions: (a) does interacting with fellow nationals who have opposing attitudes towards the Arab Spring generate less pro-social behaviour compared to situations where such disagreements are absent, and (b) whether the degree of affective polarization–if it exists–depends on the severity of the uprising’s outcome. We explore these questions by running two lab-in-the-field experiments–measuring fairness and interpersonal trust–with 1274 subjects from five Arab countries: Syrian refugees, Sudanese refugees, Jordanians, Tunisians and Egyptians. We find significant results on both fairness and trust among the Syrian sample–who experienced the most violent version of the events–and partly among Sudanese refugees. Our findings indicate that the intensity of political polarization (particularly turning it into a violent conflict and generating refugees) is critical in producing the hypothesized spillover effect of affective polarization. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Competing parties or candidates can choose to make other issues salient, such as arguing that territoriality distracts from “real issues.

Moreover, both identity and preferences could be jointly activated by some other factor. See María José Hierro and Aina Gallego, “Identities in Between: Political Conflict and Ethnonational Identities in Multicultural States Journal of Conflict Resolution, , Causality remains difficult to establish, as substate identity could either drive such preferences or be further activated due to such preferences. 62 (July 2018), 1314–39; Rico, Guillem, Liñeira, Robert, Bringing Secessionism into the Mainstream: The 2012 Regional Election in Catalonia,” South European Society and Politics, 19 (April 2014), 257–80.

A limitation of such approaches is that one cannot precisely infer the relative weight of positions because it is unclear if the individual placement of parties on issues is accurate or whether it is itself affected by individual assessments of parties. A further shortcoming is that such designs do not permit precise comparison of voters evaluations of different issues or platforms; Rodden, Jonathan A., Does Religion Distract the Poor? Income and Issue Voting Around the World (2008) Comparative Political Studies, 41, pp. 437-476. , De la O and Rodden present evidence of religious preferences outweighing redistribution preferences for some poorer voters. Ana L. De La O and (April), Tavits and Potter find that right-wing parties strategically aim to shift attention away from economics to other issues. Margit Tavits and Joshua D. Potter, “The Effect of Inequality and Social Identity on Party Strategies, American Journal of Political Science, 59 (July 2015), 744–58. Incumbent parties can also deflect attention from territorial issues.

Sambanis, Schulhofer-Wohl, and Shayo emphasize ethnic parochialism, which, they argue, predisposes individuals to support and cooperate with organizations making claims on behalf of their ethnic group. Nicholas Sambanis, Jonah Schulhofer-Wohl, and Moses Shayo, “Parochialism as a Central Challenge in Counterinsurgency, 336 (May 2012), 805–808; Identification may also be activated by intra- and inter-group interactions and group status. See Sambanis, Schulhofer-Wohl, and Shayo. Longer term sources of such attachments are varied, including early socialization through family and school (2006) Jóhanna Kristín Birnir.

(September), Additionally, this procedure avoids subjective decisions as to which policy combinations would be unrealistic or inconsistent to the respondent; We also randomized candidate gender (female or male), age (25–65 in decade increments), and a random 2-letter initial combination for candidate name to personalize each candidate, , The full text of the candidate positions is presented in the Appendix; In some cases, some of these issues are related to the center-periphery distribution of power. For example, someone who is in favor of independence can argue that sovereignty will allow the region to decide on immigration or environmental regulations. Yet, this does not imply a full overlap with the territorial cleavage. We thank one anonymous reviewer for this point; Scottish Social Attitudes poll conducted in 2019–2020, , https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-social-attitudes-2019-attitudes-government-political-engagement/, accessed 10/31/2022. The patterns in Northern Ireland and Catalonia are broadly similar; See Appendix Part A.1 for wording of the candidate options. We include the “ambiguous” policy option in the territorial dimension set as the “intermediate” candidate position (which is the “status quo” position for the other policy issues) because in the regions we are studying, the candidate advocating the “status quo” is not uniformly plausibly interpreted as having a neutral position on the territorial issue. “Ambiguity” is a more realistic “intermediate” option on this issue than other territorial positions such as “more autonomy,” which would not be equivalent to a “neutral” position, or “reducing” autonomy, which very few individuals across the regions support. In Catalonia, for example, political parties that are perceived as representing positions in between the “pro-status quo” and the “pro-independence” ones, such as En Comú Podem, tend to have ambiguous positions on the territorial issue and are viewed as posing an “in between” solution with such rhetoric. The same applies to Alliance in Northern Ireland; In robustness checks, we estimate the models with the three first set of pairs and dropping the last two pairs. The point estimates on the coefficients do not change; A combination of profiles where both candidates took identical positions on all five policies was prohibited; Northern Ireland, the effect size is similar but imprecisely estimated due to being under powered, , We present the results with the candidate choice as the dependent variable. The results are very similar when we assess candidate ranking in Scotland and Catalonia; The response options are the same, except regarding territorial preferences where we measure whether respondents support the territorial status quo, independence (or unification in Northern Ireland), or greater autonomy within the current state; The results displaying the coefficients for these variables are in tables in section D of Appendix, , As the demographic correlates of candidate choice in these regions are the foci of other research, we do not present the results here; Leeper, Thomas, Hobolt, Sara B., Tilley, James, Measuring Subgroup Preferences in Conjoint Experiments (2020) Political Analysis, 28, pp. 207-221. , We discuss how our results do not substantively differ regarding alternative baselines in the next section. (April); Hainmueller, Hopkins, Yamamoto; Leeper, Hobolt, Tilley; These questions were asked after the conjoint experiment to avoid priming candidate choice in the experiment. Tables B1-B3 of the Appendix display the descriptive statistics for the three regional samples; We note the conjoint results averaged across all the respondents to show the impact of each issue on candidate choice taking into account the other issues (displayed in Figures C1-C3 in the Appendix). In all three regions, the issue that generates the largest impact is social spending, in particular the rejection of a candidate who would reduce spending and the reward or selection of a candidate who would increase spending. This result is consistent with the literature that stresses the primacy of the left-right cleavage in European politics. We do not display these results as they are not the theoretical focus of the article; these average results obscure the heterogeneity of interest, which is whether voters reward candidates sharing their policy preferences and punish candidates with different policy preferences; Recall that each respondent’s issue preference can have three possible values Figures E1 and E2 of the Appendix we present results when we measure respondent territorial preferences in Catalonia and Scotland with a binary coding (support territorial change versus the other two positions); Following Leeper, Hobolt, and Tilley, we estimate an omnibus F-test, which indicates that the interaction terms of candidate position and respondent preference are jointly statistically significant. In the Appendix Part F, we display these results as well as the differences in candidate choice probabilities. These predicted probabilities are estimated with the baseline of the “intermediate” category regarding candidate and respondent positions; Table D3 of the Appendix presents the regression tables generating Figures 3, 4, and 5; Figures E1-E3 of the Appendix indicate that lumping “pro-autonomy” and “pro-status quo” respondents together obscures variation in candidate choice. The figure also indicates that while pro-independence and pro-territorial status quo candidates are the most rewarded by like-minded voters, the probabilities are less than one, indicating that of course other issues besides territory still matter; Rodón, Toni, Guinjoan, Marc, When the Context Matters: Identity, Secession and the Spatial Dimension in Catalonia (2018) Political Geography, 63, pp. 75-87. , These results complement those of Rodón and Guinjoan who find that dual-identity Catalan residents are more or less likely to support independence depending on contextual factors; we focus here conditioning on existing intermediate territorial preferences. (March); Also, note that even in the high-congruence cases, the predicted probability of candidate choice is not 1; it is in the range of 0.8, which, although still very high, indicates relevance of other issues; Maillot, Agnès, (2022) Rebels in Government: Is Sinn Féin Ready for Power, , This could be because Sinn Féin, who are the main advocates of a united Ireland, have also positioned themselves as the main advocates of social welfare. (Manchester University Press). Some political observers argue that, in the May 2022 elections in Northern Ireland, emphasis on social issues helped the party electorally; In the Appendix (Figure G1), we include the results with predicted selection of candidates with ambiguous territorial positions, who in principle should be more congruent with the pro-autonomy individuals on the territorial issue compared to the pro- or anti-independence candidates. It also shows that for such pro-autonomy individuals, congruence on spending matters more than on territorial preferences; Balcells and Kuo also find that territorial moderates in Catalonia (i.e., anti-independence but pro-increased autonomy within Spain) are less affectively polarized about the territorial issue than individuals at the poles.

abstract={How does historical victimization and its memorialization impact present-day outgroup attitudes in conflict-riven societies? This study explores this question using a survey experiment with a representative sample of 2000 Jewish Israelis—half of whom are direct descendants of Holocaust survivors—and a content analysis of 98 state-approved school textbooks, examining how histories of victimization become socialized and shape political attitudes. We find that, in Israel, family victimization during the Holocaust plays surprisingly little role in shaping present-day attitudes toward outgroups. Rather, perceived historical victimization of the Jewish and Israeli people is broadly socialized among the Israeli public and is a stronger predictor of outgroup (in)tolerance. These findings shed light on the power of societal victimhood narratives—even in the absence of personal family histories of victimization—to shape political attitudes in conflict contexts, with long-term implications for intergroup cooperation and conflict. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={In contexts of democratic backsliding, citizens represent the last bulwark against the systematic dismantling of checks and balances by overbearing executives. And yet, they repeatedly fail to punish authoritarian-leaning leaders at the ballot box, allowing them to consolidate their grip on power. Why is that so? We leverage a conjoint survey experiment in Hungary to probe competing mechanisms of citizen tolerance towards democratic violations in a context of severe backsliding. Our main contribution consists of demonstrating empirically the presence of a composite effect, whereby authoritarian-leaning elites succeed in offering targeted compensations to different groups, ultimately building a mosaic of support among voters to secure enduring electoral backing. We pinpoint trade-offs notably related to cultural conservatism and economic benefits among different subgroups of the population. At the same time, our empirical findings indicate surprisingly high levels of condemnation of undemocratic positions by Hungarian respondents. We discuss how this unexpected pattern points to the limitations of conjoint designs as well as the overlooked supply side of democratic backsliding. Our study feeds into broader debates about the unfolding and entrenchment of democratic backsliding and how we study these processes. © 2023 The Author(s).

abstract={Economic explanations are central to our understanding of popular support for authoritarian regimes. Yet, we do not know to what extent economic evaluations of citizens living under these regimes are amenable to regime propaganda. This article engages with this question by relying on the case of Turkey, where the authoritarian regime led by Erdoğan has been able to sustain its popular support despite years of economic decline. A national developmentalist narrative has been central to the regime’s economic propaganda in Turkey since 2011. Relying on national face-to-face survey data, I first demonstrate that economic misperceptions grounded in this narrative are widespread among supporters of the ruling coalition in Turkey. I then use an online survey experiment to show that exposure to the developmentalist narrative improves economic evaluations among ruling coalition voters. These effects are mediated through the increase in partisan emotions, and they are especially large for non-partisan voters of the ruling coalition. These results help us understand how Erdoğan’s regime could sustain its popular support despite years of economic decline. From a broader perspective, this article demonstrates that scholars of authoritarian regimes need to pay more attention to economic narratives and their affective structures. © 2023 The Author(s).

abstract={Most aid project output does not last long after the departure of external donors. This inconvenient truth remains unchanged despite the introduction decades ago of participatory approaches and the alignment of aid content, on the belief that they would cure this problem via the generation of a sense of ownership and the reduction in recurrent costs. To understand this paradox, this study re-examines the impact of participation and alignment on the sustainability of aid project output through a field experiment in Uganda using an aid project that promotes household water treatment and safe storage (HWTS) as an example. The results reveal that the true impact of alignment is negative, while the impact of participation is zero. Specifically, when the aid content is changed from nonaligned to aligned while the use of a nonparticipatory approach is unchanged, the rate of HWTS retention drops by 35.4 percentage points after 2 weeks and by 43.7 percentage points after another 4 months. This finding suggests that at least the unconditional alignment of aid content should be reconsidered to prevent the further deterioration of already unsustainable aid project output. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Recent studies of clientelism predominantly focus on how elites use rewards to influence vote choices and turnout. This article shifts attention toward citizens and their choices beyond the ballot box. Under what conditions does clientelism influence citizens’ decisions to express political preferences publicly? When voters can obtain post-election benefits by declaring support for victorious candidates, their choices to display political paraphernalia on their homes or bodies may reflect more than just political preferences. We argue that various factors—such as the size of rewards and punishments, the competitiveness of the election, and whether multiple candidates employ clientelism—affect citizens’ propensity to declare support in response to clientelist inducements. Building on insights from fieldwork, formal analyses reveal how and why such factors can distort patterns of political expression observed during electoral campaigns. We conduct an experiment in Brazil, which predominantly corroborates predictions about declared support and clientelism. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Nonviolent campaigns against repressive regimes often turn on the military’s decision to either defend the ruler or make common cause with the ruled. Yet surprisingly little scholarship investigates opposition expectations for the military’s likely response to mass protest. We theorize that some determinants of the military’s willingness to repress are more observable to activists than others. In particular, we identify conscription as a highly salient indicator that soldiers will refuse to fire on protesters and hypothesize that nonviolent campaigns are more likely to materialize against regimes with conscripted armies than those with volunteer forces. We substantiate this theory with two sources of evidence: (1) a survey experiment conducted during the 2019 Algerian Revolution and (2) a cross-national analysis of the positive association between conscription and nonviolent campaign onset from 1945 to 2013. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Following Lebo and Cassino 723), partisan bias in opinion formation occurs through at least three mechanisms: i) selective exposure to information, whereby individuals actively seek out new evidence that is consistent with their prior views; ii) selective judgement, whereby individuals evaluate attitude-consistent arguments as stronger and spend considerable energy in denigrating arguments that run counter to existing beliefs ("disconfirmation bias"); and iii) selective perception, where people respond to unfavorable information in agreement with their pre-existing beliefs and reinforce a view this information should otherwise undermine. We build on ii) and iii) in our argument, whereas i) is less important here since our vignette experiment randomly varies the information provided to the respondent; Bratton, Michael, Vote Buying and Violence in Nigerian Election Campaigns (2008) Electoral Studies, 27, pp. 621-632. , (December); Lebo and Cassino; Lelkes, Yphtach, Westwood, Sean J., The Limits of Partisan Prejudice (2017) The Journal of Politics, 79, pp. 485-501. , (April); Such allegations might even lead to more positive evaluations of elections if the process of counterarguing information as unimportant or false also leads individuals to recall other positive features of the process, , as Redlawsk notes; Bunce, Valerie J., Wolchik, Sharon L., Defeating Dictators: Electoral Change and Stability in Competitive Authoritarian Regimes (2010), 62, pp. 43-86. , World Politics, (January), Lars-Erik Cederman, Kristian Skrede Gleditsch, and Simon Hug, "Elections and Ethnic Civil War, Comparative Political Studies, 46 (March 2013), 387-417; Donno, Morrison, and Savun; ; Kalmoe, Nathan P., (2019) Legitimizing Partisan Violence: Evidence of Political Bias in State Violence Views from Four Experiments, , https://nathankalmoe.com/research-2/, Unpublished working paper, also Lelkes and Westwood; Anderson, Flesken, Anaïd, Hartl, Jakob, Party Support, Values, and Perceptions of Electoral Integrity (2018) Political Psychology, 39. , Cantú and García-Ponce; and, (June), 707-24; Devra C.

Our results are not sensitive to re-coding these respondents either as non-partisan or missing; The questionnaire also contained a survey item where we asked people directly about their vote choice in the past election. Such a measure conflates support for a party with stated vote choice, which is not ideal and why we prefer our trust in parties measure. Cross-tabulations of the vote choice and trust in parties variables show that respondents who voted for the TMC or BJP also expressed trust in these parties. 163 of 189 respondents who voted for the TMC indicated trust in the party. For the BJP, 183 of 200 BJP voters expressed trust in the BJP; Gerber and Green; Our pre-analysis plan included a hypothesis on the direct effect of information about violence as a test of the rational updating perspective.

abstract={The share of basic services that NGOs deliver has grown dramatically in developing countries due to increased receipt of aid and philanthropy in these countries. Many scholars and practitioners worry that NGOs reduce reliance on government services and, in turn, lower demand for government provision and undermine political engagement. Others argue that NGOs prop-up poorly performing governments that receive undeserved credit for the production, allocation, or welfare effects of NGO services. Using original surveys and a randomized health intervention, implemented in parallel to a similar universal government program, this article investigates the long-term effect of NGO provision on political attitudes and behavior. Access to NGO services increased preferences for NGO, relative to government, provision. However, political engagement and perceptions of government legitimacy were unaffected. Instead, the intervention generated political credit for the incumbent president. This study finds that citizens see NGOs as a resource that powerful government actors control, and they reward actors who they see as responsible for allocation of those resources.

abstract={Oil and gas discoveries in developing countries are often associated with shortsighted economic policies and, in response, with calls to insulate resource management from populist impulses. The authors report on a randomized experiment that tested methods to overcome this apparent tension between sound resource governance and democratic politics. Soon after Tanzania's discovery of major natural gas reserves, the authors invited a nationally representative sample of voters to take part in an intensive public deliberation of policy options, at an event featuring nationally recognized experts and small-group discussions. Democratic deliberation reinforced the public's strong preference for rapid spending of gas revenues, but also increased support for various prudential and economically orthodox measures, such as the independent oversight of gas revenues, limits on government borrowing, and selling gas abroad rather than subsidizing fuel at home. These effects were driven by deliberation per se, rather than a pure information treatment, and show no evidence of contamination by facilitator effects or peer effects in group deliberations.

abstract={China’s “economic juggernaut” is often noted to have arisen from successful market reforms carried out in the context of high state capacity. In contrast, we demonstrate that crucial reforms to replace central planning with markets have stalled as a result of major barriers of two types: institutional and ideational. Focusing on the electricity sector, we find that market reforms pushed by China’s central government are hindered by deep inefficiencies that arise from the legacy plan and “plan-derived” institutions of subnational governments and grid companies, against which the central state has been largely ineffective. We also uncover fascinating ideational differences of the nature and purpose of “markets” that show how they often are envisioned more as a way to extend the planner’s “toolbox,” or to offer “salvation” for ailing incumbent firms, rather than to induce efficiency. Our empirical focus on three prominent types of “market-oriented” experiments in the electric power sector demonstrate clear limits to state capacity, limits that emanate from state actors rather than merely industry, despite high-priority central government goals of increasing efficiency, integrating renewable energy, and reducing emissions from the electricity sector. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Countries in the Global South are particularly vulnerable to social and political violence. This paper suggests that such violence makes certain recalcitrant economic interests more open to taxes and spending on social welfare. Using results from a survey experiment of business owners and operators in Mexico, we show that relative to more innocuous institutional weaknesses, concerns over violence generally increase support for anti-poverty spending and decrease support for tax cuts. To build a theory, we explore heterogeneous effects and textual data. The findings suggest that business interests see anti-poverty spending as a tool for shoring up costs of violence in consumer markets, with some leaders even extending support to welfare-enhancing taxes. However, violence can create challenges in labor markets that increase operational costs, leading some business interests to resist tax policies that ask them to help fund social programs. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Illiberal regimes use overt and covert political communication to influence public opinion in democracies. We present an argument about how such propaganda impacts targeted publics. We posit that effectiveness depends on whether the source of the message is revealed, on the nature of the issue, and on individual characteristics of the recipients. We test these propositions in Germany, in the context of Kremlin messaging, using eight survey experiments administered to a large sample of German voters (n = 2, 303). Citizens who mistrust the government, believe in conspiracy theories, or are generally disconnected from politics are vulnerable to propaganda warfare that involves anti-mainstream messaging, while the rest of the populace is not. At the same time, providing a pro-Western, mainstream viewpoint and outing the Russian source are not generally effective countermeasures.

abstract={An influential body of scholarship argues that authoritarian regimes design “hard” propaganda that is intentionally heavy-handed in order to signal regime power. In this study, by contrast, we link the power of propaganda to the emotional power of “soft” propaganda such as television dramas and viral social media content. We conduct a series of experiments in which we expose over 6800 respondents in China to real propaganda videos drawn from television dramas, state-backed social media accounts, and state-run newscasts, each containing nationalist messages favored by the Chinese Communist Party. In contrast to theories that propaganda is unpersuasive, we show that propaganda effectively manipulates anger as well as anti-foreign sentiment and behavior, with heightened anti-foreign attitudes persisting up to a week. However, we also find that nationalist propaganda has no effect on perceptions of Chinese government performance or on self-reported willingness to protest against the state. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Do existing theories regarding the impact of foreign migration explain preferences in non-oecd countries? The author adapts and applies explanations for opposition to migration in the Arabian Gulf, a significant region in global migration today, using a survey experiment implemented in Qatar. The results offer a rare validation of predictions from the labor market competition model, demonstrating that individual employment circumstances are important preference determinants. Additionally, while OECD citizens prefer high-skilled migrants, Qataris are indifferent about blue- versus white-collar workers. Mediation analysis suggests that this null effect is the result of competing cultural and economic concerns over the effect of differing classes of migrants on economic and social welfare. The novel context provides a critical test case of the labor market hypothesis and offers insight into how migration preferences in the Global South differ from the Western experience.

abstract={Morally charged rhetoric is commonplace in political discourse on immigration but scholars have not examined how it affects divisions over the issue among the public. To address this gap, we employ preregistered survey experiments in two countries where anti-immigration rhetoric has been prominent: the United States and Denmark. We demonstrate that exposure to moralized messages leads respondents to place greater moral weight on their existing immigration opinions and become more averse to political leaders and, in the United States, social interaction partners who espouse opposite beliefs. This suggests that political moralization contributes to moral conflict and affective polarization. We find no evidence, however, that moral framing produces attitudinal polarization—that is, more extreme immigration opinions. Our study helps make sense of the heightened intensity of anti-immigrant politics even when attitudes are stable. It also suggests a promising avenue for comparative research on affective polarization by shifting the focus from partisanship to the moralization of existing issue disagreements. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Winners and losers of elections have different stakes in protecting democratic institutions. We provide new evidence for the effects of partisanship and economic performance on support for checks and balances and acceptance of their infringement. Using survey data from 26 European countries, we show that voters who feel close to a political party that lost the elections support checks and balances significantly more than other citizens. We also find that higher satisfaction with the economy is associated with lower support for checks and balances. Our experiment in Ukraine shows that supporters and opponents of the governing party have divergent evaluations of a reform potentially infringing on the independence of the judiciary. Those in opposition find such reforms less acceptable and justified. Again, we find that improved economic performance leads to higher acceptance of judicial reform. Our results confirm that citizens’ support for checks and balances is contingent and volatile. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Do individuals previously targeted by genocide become more supportive of other victimized groups? How are these political lessons internalized and passed down across generations? To answer these questions, the authors leverage original survey data collected among Holocaust survivors in the United States and their descendants, Jews with no immediate family connection to the Holocaust, and non-Jewish Americans. They find that historical victimization is associated with increased support for vulnerable out-groups, generating stable political attitudes that endure across generations. Holocaust survivors are most supportive of aiding refugees, followed by descendants, especially those who grew up discussing the Holocaust with their survivor relatives. An embedded experiment demonstrates the steadfastness of these attitudes: unlike non-Jews or Jews without survivor relatives, survivors' and descendants' views toward refugees do not change after reading an in-group versus out-group-protective interpretation of the never again imperative. Histories of victimization can play an ameliorative role in intergroup relations. Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Princeton University.},

abstract={Experimental evidence suggests that decision makers with proposal power are held responsible for collective decisions. In the case of coalition governments, voter heuristics assign responsibility for economic outcomes to individual parties, directing the economic vote toward the Prime Minister party. Using extensive survey data from 1988 to 2010 in 28 democracies, we demonstrate that voters also identify the Finance Minister party as responsible depending on whether the coalition context exaggerates or mutes its perceived agenda power. When parties take ownership for particular policy areas, and decision-making is compartmentalized, voters perceive the Finance Minister as having proposal power and it receives a larger economic vote. Online survey experiments in Ireland and the Netherlands confirm that subjects employ compartmentalization signals to identify, and punish, coalition parties with proposal power. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={This article provides a systematic examination of the role of security considerations in shaping mass preferences over international economic exchange. The authors employ multiple survey experiments conducted in the United States and India, along with observational and case study evidence, to investigate how geopolitics affects voters’ views of international trade. Their research shows that respondents consistently—and by large margins—prefer trading with allies over adversaries. Negative prior beliefs about adversaries, amplified by concerns that trade will bolster the partner’s military, account for this preference. Yet the authors also find that a significant proportion of the public believes that trade can lead to peace and that the peace-inducing aspects of trade can cause voters to overcome their aversion to trade with adversaries. This article helps explain when and why governments constrained by public opinion pursue economic cooperation in the shadow of conflict. Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Princeton University.},

abstract={While delegation of policymaking authority from citizens to parliament is the most defining characteristic of representative democracy, public demand for delegating such authority away from legislature/government to technocrats or back to citizens appears to have increased. Drawing on spatial models of voting, we argue that the distance between individuals’ ideal policy points, the status quo, experts’ policy positions and aggregated societal policy preferences can help explain whether individuals prefer to delegate decision-making power away from parliament and, if so, to whom. The effects of individual’s preference distance from these ideal points are likely to be stronger the more salient the policy issue is for the respective individual. We test this argument using survey experiments in Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The analysis provides evidence for the empirical implications of our theoretical arguments. The research presented here contributes to better understanding variation in citizens’ support for representative democracy and preferences for delegating policymaking authority away from parliament. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Does electoral competition increase affective polarization? Can inter-party cooperation depolarize voters? Addressing these questions is challenging since both competition and cooperation are endogenous to political attitudes. Building on social identity theory and leveraging a natural experiment unfolding over seven Israeli election studies, we demonstrate that the enhanced salience of electoral competition increases affective polarization. We then consider whether inter-party cooperation can depolarize the electorate. To do so, we further build on theories of coalition ambivalence and party brands and leverage the ambiguity around coalition building following elections of Israel’s 22nd Knesset, to implement a survey experiment where we credibly shape respondents’ perceptions regarding the likelihood that a unity government will form. We find that priming party cooperation in the form of a unity government promotes tolerance across partisan lines. Our studies contribute to the affective polarization literature by identifying institutional causes and remedies of polarization in a comparative context. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Surveys around the world report exceptionally high levels of support for the military. This is particularly relevant for countries in transition from authoritarian rule to democracy, where militaries can play a vital role for democratic consolidation or autocratic backsliding. Given the sensitive nature of the issue, we suspect that figures indicating strong support for the military are at least partly driven by sensitivity bias. We explore this possibility through list experiments in two nationally representative surveys in Tunisia. We find that misreporting of support for the military in Tunisia is substantial, with respondents overreporting positive attitudes by 40–50 percentage points. Moreover, misreporting is not random, but instead varies systematically by incumbency, with supporters of governing parties misreporting support for the military to a significantly higher degree than opposition supporters or non-voters. Our results suggest that public opinion researchers should be wary of using direct questions to measure support for the military. © 2022 The Author(s).

abstract={Why do voters support executive aggrandizement? One possible answer is that they do so because they think this will ease their preferred leader’s hand in putting their partisan vision into action, provided that the leader will continue winning elections. We study this phenomenon through a survey experiment in Turkey, by manipulating voters’ perceptions about the potential results of the first presidential election after a constitutional referendum of executive aggrandizement. We find that voters from both sides display what we call “elastic support” for executive aggrandizement; that is, they change previously revealed constitutional preferences in response to varying winning chances. This elasticity increases not only when citizens feel greater social distance to perceived political “others” (i.e., affective polarization) but also when voters are concerned about economic management in a potential post-incumbent era. Our findings contribute to the literature on how polarization and economic anxiety contribute to executive aggrandizement and democratic backsliding.1 © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={In June 2020, President Trump issued an executive order calling for the deployment of federal law enforcement agents to protests against police brutality. Several mayors across the country objected to this unilateral deployment of federal force as unconstitutional. In an online survey experiment, we test whether the public stands against this type of federal power aggrandizement by evaluating how approval of federal intervention in protests changes depending on whether it is requested by local mayors or directed by the presidential administration. The results show that the public is responsive to the level of government directing the action. Respondents are significantly less approving of the use of federal forces when it is directed by the federal executive branch. However, not all subgroups respond equally to the manipulation. The treatment effects vary significantly by respondent partisanship, trust in government, and perceptions of the importance of federalism. © 2022 The Author(s).},

abstract={As Congress remains gridlocked on the issue of comprehensive immigration reform, immigration policy debates, particularly with respect to interior immigration enforcement, are increasingly taking place at state and local levels. Scholarship on immigration federalism has focused on federal and local governments, while states are passing laws that tighten or delimit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (i.e., "sanctuary policies"). Simultaneously, cities are passing laws contradictory to state policy. We examine how these state and local enforcement ambiguities affect undocumented immigrants' trust in the efficacy of sanctuary policies. Using California as a case, we embedded an experiment in a survey of undocumented immigrants and find trust in sanctuary policies decreases when cities seek to opt out of statewide sanctuary laws. Further, "opting out"has negative implications for the daily behavior of undocumented immigrants, like the chilling effects resulting from local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Leaders of military coups routinely deny that their actions amount to a coup, often labelling them as revolutions or even constitutional successions. These attempts to muddy the waters occasionally succeed in prompting discussions over whether the military’s actions truly amount to a coup. But does the label matter? Does public support for military intervention decrease when it is labelled a coup? If so, how large is this “coup taboo”? In this article, we provide the first empirical evidence of the coup taboo across three large-scale survey experiments in Egypt, Algeria, and Tunisia. Across all three countries, we find that the coup taboo is substantial, with support for the military hypothetically removing the president falling by 15–50 percentage points when labelled as a coup. These results underscore the importance of labels, and suggest that anti-coup norms may be superficial, decreasing support for military interventions only when labelled as coups. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Authors writing since the late 1800s have argued that the requirement to vote can transform citizens, especially by inducing political sophistication. This implies the criteria that compelled voters use to choose between candidates will differ from those who are not obligated to turn out. To test this, I amalgamate a conjoint experiment with a regression discontinuity design, exploiting age-based cutoffs in the application of compulsory voting. This allows me to causally identify the impact of compulsory voting on the attributes individuals take into account when choosing between candidates. While I recover compulsory voting’s upward impact on turnout, I find no evidence that compelled and voluntary voters differ in how they select candidates. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Despite recent attention to the economic and political consequences of automation and technological change for workers, we lack data about concerns and policy preferences about this structural change. We present hypotheses about the relationships among automation risk, subjective concerns about technology, and policy preferences. We distinguish between preferences for compensatory policies versus “protectionist” policies to prevent such technological change. Using original survey data from Spain that captures multiple measures of automation risk, we find that most workers believe that the impact of new technologies in the workplace is positive, but there is a concerned minority. Technological concern varies with objective vulnerability, as workers at higher risk of technological displacement are more likely to negatively view technology. Both correlational and experimental analyses indicate little evidence that workers at risk or technologically concerned are more likely to demand compensation. Instead, workers concerned about technological displacement prefer policies to slow down technological change. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={In many countries, voters are targeted with clientelistic and programmatic electoral offers. Existing research explores the demand side of clientelism, but we still know very little about what determines voters’ acceptance of clientelistic and programmatic electoral offers. This article builds a novel theoretical framework on the role that democratic dissatisfaction and political knowledge play in shaping voters’ acceptance of different types of electoral offers. We test the implications of the theory with a survey experiment conducted after the 2019 local elections in Bulgaria. Our results show that low-knowledge voters and those who are dissatisfied with the performance of democracy and democratic institutions are more likely to accept clientelistic offers from politicians. The findings contribute to the literature on electoral clientelism and political attitudes. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Standard theories in comparative political economy predict that labor market insiders oppose redistribution to poorer, often informal, labor market outsiders. In contrast, I argue that not all insiders oppose redistribution to outsiders. Extending recent work emphasizing the importance of economic insecurity for insiders, I argue that exposure to risk leads to greater polarization regarding preferences for non-contributory social policy between low- and high-skilled insiders. I test implications of this logic using a survey experiment from a nationally representative sample in Argentina and complement this with analysis of observational data for 16 Latin American countries. I find strong evidence of polarization regarding preferences over social protection among low- and high-skilled insiders. The experiment reveals that low (high)-skilled insiders primed about the risk of becoming outsiders become more supportive of transfers to outsiders (insiders). The article provides new micro-foundations for insider–outsider coalitions in support of social policy expansion in middle-income countries. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Why do some indigenous groups achieve coethnic political representation while others do not? In this paper, I highlight the primary role of communal property in shaping indigenous representation. While scholars often laud the developmental benefits of communal land titling, I argue that formalizing collectively held land can inhibit indigenous coordination to achieve political representation. Where communal land is informally held, indigenous groups are more likely to invest in traditional institutions that facilitate collective action to elect coethnic candidates to political office. Conversely, titling communal property secures indigenous land access but in the process erodes traditional institutions that would otherwise promote collective action during elections. I test my argument using a multi-method approach that includes interviews and experiments with three-hundred Peruvian indigenous leaders, historical land-title data, and information scraped from mayoral candidate CVs. The findings suggest that the oft-cited economic benefits of collective property may generate negative political effects. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={How do major national events influence attitudes toward non-nationals? Recent research suggests that national sports team wins help foster national pride, weaken ethnic attachments, and build trust among conational out-group members. This paper asks a related question: By heightening nationalism, do these victories also affect attitudes toward foreign out-groups, specifically refugees? We examine this question using the 2019 Africa Cup football match between Kenya and Tanzania, which Kenya narrowly won, coupled with an online survey experiment conducted with a panel of 2,647 respondents recruited through Facebook. We find that winning increases national pride and preferences for resource allocation toward conationals, but it also leads to negative views of refugees’ contribution to the country’s diversity. However, we present experimental evidence that reframing national sports victories as a product of cooperation among diverse players and highlighting shared superordinate identities can offset these views and help foster positive attitudes toward refugees. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={As populist radical right parties muster increasing support in many democracies, an important question is how mainstream parties can recapture their voters. Focusing on Germany, we present original panel evidence that voters supporting the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD)—the country’s largest populist radical right party—resemble partisan loyalists with entrenched anti-establishment views, seemingly beyond recapture by mainstream parties. Yet this loyalty does not only reflect anti-establishment voting, but also gridlocked party-issue positioning. Despite descriptive evidence of strong party loyalty, experimental evidence reveals that many AfD voters change allegiances when mainstream parties accommodate their preferences. However, for most parties this repositioning is extremely costly. While mainstream parties can attract populist radical right voters via restrictive immigration policies, they alienate their own voters in doing so. Examining position shifts across issue dimensions, parties, and voter groups, our research demonstrates that, absent significant changes in issue preferences or salience, the status quo is an equilibrium. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Are slum dwellers more involved in clientelistic arrangements than other (urban poor) voters? While poverty is a key predictor of clientelism, some urban poor voters are more involved in clientelistic arrangements than others. Insecure tenure, lack of access to public resources, and location in areas exposed to environmental shocks increase the vulnerability of slum dwellers. This vulnerability is used by politicians and brokers, who politicize access to scarce resources, and thus make slum dweller more exposed to clientelism. The qualitative literature has long highlighted how clientelism provides a strategy for slum dwellers to cope with their vulnerability, but this population is often excluded from quantitative analyses of clientelism. Using survey data from Argentina and a matching technique that allows us to compare slum dwellers with similar non-slum dwellers, we find that there is indeed a higher prevalence of clientelism among the former. We use a survey experiment on monitoring and sanctions to show that this different exposure to clientelism is consequential. We find different responses across similarly poor slum dwellers and non-slum dwellers regarding the potential consequences of defecting from clientelistic arrangements. Our findings suggest that including slum dwellers in quantitative analyses would improve our understanding of clientelism. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Politicians and media frequently invoke immigration threats to shape public opinion. But how do outgroup threat frames affect norms of citizenship, including behavior, liberal value commitments, and national belonging? This paper presents evidence from an embedded vignette survey experiment in three immigrant-receiving societies: United States, United Kingdom, and Germany. I find immigration threats are filtered through partisanship in polarized settings, and asymmetrically affect norms of “good citizenship” among individuals on the partisan left. However, we see variation within this group: Democrats (US) de-value norms of behavior, like voting and being informed, while Labor supports (UK) repudiate liberal norms like tolerance and rally around national belonging. By contrast, in Germany, we observe more consensus in citizenship norm responses. The strong effect of immigration threat framing on the partisan left brings our attention to the strategic use of immigration discourse to move traditionally sympathetic citizens away from democratic civic ideals. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Apology diplomacy promises to assuage historical grievances held by foreign publics, yet in practice appears to ignite domestic backlash, raising questions about its efficacy. This article develops a theory of how political apologies affect public approval of an apologizing government across domestic and foreign contexts. The authors test its implications using large-scale survey experiments in Japan and the United States. In the surveys, the authors present vignettes about World War II grievances and randomize the nature of a government apology. They find that apology-making, both as statements acknowledging wrongdoing and as expressions of remorse, boosts approval in the recipient state. But in the apologizing state, backlash is likely among individuals with strong hierarchical group dispositions-manifested as nationalism, social-dominance orientation, and conservatism-and among those who do not consider the recipient a strategically important partner. This microlevel evidence reveals how leaders face a crucial trade-off between improving support abroad and risking backlash at home, with implications for the study of diplomatic communication and transitional justice.

abstract={How do autocrats build support? This study argues that autocrats create and maintain participatory technologies—elite-mass communication strategies that promote two-way interaction between citizens and leaders—to foster support. Participatory technologies provide citizens with the opportunity to have a limited voice in otherwise closed political systems. I test this theory through a series of two nationally-representative survey experiments in Russia. Results suggest that awareness of participatory technologies increases approval of President Putin and improves perceptions that there are opportunities for voice in politics. This finding departs from previous research that suggests public opinion is influenced primarily by participation. Furthermore, I demonstrate that these effects can be directly attributed to the communicative format of these strategies, not to issue resolution or leadership effects. Finally, I demonstrate that effects are dependent upon individuals’ political sophistication and political priors, contributing to political polarization and opening up the potential for backlash against the regime. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Authoritarian regimes sometimes professionalize their legal systems to govern more effectively. Yet when quasi-autonomous courts rule in contradiction to popular conceptions of right and wrong—popular morality—it might threaten citizens’ trust in the regime. We use the case of contemporary China to investigate this “moral-legal dilemma”—the competing needs of legal development and the satisfaction of popular justice concerns. Four case studies demonstrate that when court rulings conflict with popular morality, the party-state selectively alters decisions, so long as intervention does not significantly jeopardize the integrity of the legal system. Two online survey experiments then assess citizens’ reactions to moral-legal conflict in court rulings. We find that people are more likely to experience “moral dissonance” when legal decisions conflict with popular morality. We do not find that moral-legal conflict in court rulings significantly undermines individuals’ trust in the regime. Our analysis underscores the need for more attention to the moral foundations of authoritarian rule. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Drawing on experimental games and surveys conducted with students at two universities in Russia, we compare the behavioral, attitudinal, and demographic traits of students seeking public sector employment to the traits of their peers seeking jobs in the private sector. Contrary to similar studies conducted in other high-corruption contexts, such as India, we find evidence that students who prefer a public sector career display less willingness to cheat or bribe in experimental games as well as higher levels of altruism. However, disaggregating public sector career paths reveals distinctions between the federal civil service and other types of public sector employment, with federal government positions attracting students who exhibit some similarities with their peers aspiring to private sector careers. We discuss multiple interpretations consistent with our findings, each of which has implications for the creation of effective anti-corruption policies and for understanding of state capacity in contexts where corruption is widespread. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={What are the effects of foreign aid on the perceived legitimacy of recipient states? Different donors adhere to different rules, principles, and operating procedures. The authors theorize that variation in these aid regimes may generate variation in the effects of aid on state legitimacy. To test their theory, they compare aid from the United States to aid from China, its most prominent geopolitical rival. Their research design combines within-country analysis of original surveys, survey experiments, and behavioral games in Liberia with cross-country analysis of existing administrative and Afrobarometer data from six African countries. They exploit multiple proxies for state legitimacy, but focus in particular on tax compliance and morale. Contrary to expectations, the authors find little evidence to suggest that exposure to aid diminishes the legitimacy of African states. If anything, the opposite appears to be true. Their results are consistent across multiple settings, multiple levels of analysis, and multiple measurement and identification strategies, and are unlikely to be artifacts of sample selection, statistical power, or the strength or weakness of particular experimental treatments. The authors conclude that the effects of aid on state legitimacy at the microlevel are largely benign. Copyright © Trustees of Princeton University 2021.},

abstract={Recent elections have featured various politicians directly appealing to the working class, yet we know little about how citizens react to class appeals from candidates. We investigate this question using survey experiments conducted in the United States and Denmark. We show that symbolic class rhetoric substantially influences candidate evaluations and ultimately polarizes these evaluations across class lines. We also unpack how class appeals work and find that while they increase perceptions of representation among working class voters, they have a more limited effect on perceptions of candidates’ ideological position. Our results help explain how class affects voter decision-making and contribute to broader discussions about the role of political elites in activating social cleavages. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Does electoral fraud stabilize authoritarian rule or undermine it? The answer to this question rests in part on how voters evaluate regime candidates who engage in fraud. Using a survey experiment conducted after the 2016 elections in Russia, the authors find that voters withdraw their support from ruling party candidates who commit electoral fraud. This effect is especially large among strong supporters of the regime. Core regime supporters are more likely to have ex ante beliefs that elections are free and fair. Revealing that fraud has occurred significantly reduces their propensity to support the regime. The authors' findings illustrate that fraud is costly for autocrats not just because it may ignite protest, but also because it can undermine the regime's core base of electoral support. Because many of its strongest supporters expect free and fair elections, the regime has strong incentives to conceal or otherwise limit its use of electoral fraud.

abstract={Governments around the world, particularly authoritarian ones, often deny inconvenient or unfavorable information, calling it fake news or false rumor, and yet what was denied often turns out to be true eventually. How will citizens react when the initial “fake news” is verified to be real? What are the consequences of false government denials on government credibility and citizen satisfaction? Using a survey experiment in China and a follow-up survey, we find that citizens can be persuaded by the authorities’ denials and reduce their belief in a piece of news that has been declared “fake.” But when the denied news turns out to be real, citizens will reduce their belief not only in the denial at hand but also in a similar denial in the future and reduce their satisfaction with the government. Thus, false denials have both immediate and lasting effects on government credibility and can erode citizen satisfaction with the government. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Anti-immigration preferences among educated and racially egalitarian voters is hard to explain using existing frameworks of self-interest or prejudice. I address this puzzle by developing a theory of parochial altruism, which stipulates that voters are motivated to help others at a cost, but they prioritize helping compatriots. I hypothesize that parochial altruists or voters high in both “nationalism” and “altruism” are more supportive of immigration restrictions perceived to be in the national interest. However, parochial altruists are also expected to be more supportive of increasing immigration when it benefits their compatriots. I test my theory by conducting a population-based UK survey. Using a novel measure of elicited preferences, I first find most altruists who donate to domestic rather than global charities are as anti-immigration as egoists who do not donate at all. Using a conjoint experiment, I then show voters support increasing immigration when these alternative policies benefit their compatriots. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={With international migration at a record high, a burgeoning literature has explored the drivers of public attitudes toward migrants. However, most studies to date have focused on developed countries, which have relatively fewer migrants and more capacity to absorb them. We address this sample bias by conducting a survey of public attitudes toward Syrians in Jordan, a developing country with one of the largest shares of refugees. Our analysis indicates that neither personal- nor community-level exposure to the economic impact of the refugee crisis is associated with antimigrant sentiments among natives. Furthermore, an embedded conjoint experiment validated with qualitative evidence demonstrates the relative importance of humanitarian and cultural concerns over economic ones. Taken together, our findings weaken the case for egocentric and sociotropic economic concerns as critical drivers of antimigrant attitudes and demonstrate how humanitarian motives can sustain support for refugees when host and migrant cultures are similar. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={What motivates legislators to respond to citizen-initiated contacts about policy positions in party-centred systems with limited re-election incentives? We argue legislators are more responsive to individual citizens when they are being contacted about high-profile, salient policy issues, and when they have the relevant experience and staff resources to attend to individual requests. Using a field experiment where we email Mexican senators about their policy positions before casting eight different floor votes across nine months, we find substantial support for our argument. The article challenges the notion of re-election-based responsiveness by arguing that issue-visibility, access to individual resources, and personal political experience explain variation in communicative responsiveness in party-centred legislatures. Such findings hold critical implications for theories of democratic representation, suggesting the incentive to establish significant communicative relations with constituents does not only stem from incentives to cultivate a personal vote. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Can democratic orientations and political participation in fragile democracies be fostered through civic education? Early evaluation work reported generally positive effects, though recent work has been more skeptical, with some studies reporting negative impacts of civic education on political engagement through highlighting the poor performance of incumbents and ongoing political processes. In this article, we report the results of a field experiment using an encouragement design to assess the Voter Opinion and Involvement through Civic Education (VOICE) programme conducted in 2010-2011 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We adapt Bratton and Mattes’ (2007) “supply and demand” model of democratic support to the case of civic education, and derive hypotheses regarding expected impacts of VOICE on a series of democratic orientations and political participation. The results show that the VOICE programme had negative effects on support for the decentralization process and on individuals’ satisfaction with democracy in the DRC, and positive effects on non-electoral participation as well as on democratic orientations such as knowledge, efficacy, and political tolerance. We suggest that this pattern of effects has positive normative implications, and that civic education programmes continue to have the potential to deepen democratic engagement and values, even in fragile or backsliding democratic settings. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This article leverages a phenomenon of racial reclassification in Brazil to shed new light on the processes of identity politicization. Conventional wisdom tells us that race mixture, fluid racial boundaries, and stigmatized blackness lead Brazilians to change their racial identifications-To reclassify-Toward whiteness. But in recent years, Brazilians have demonstrated a newfound tendency to reclassify toward blackness. The author argues that this sudden reversal is the unintended consequence of state-led educational expansion for the lower classes. Educational expansion has increased the exposure of newly mobile citizens to information, social networks, and the labor market, leading many to develop racialized political identities and choose blackness. The author develops and tests this argument by drawing on in-depth interview data, systematic analyses of national survey and longitudinal census data, and original survey experiments. This article contributes a novel account of identity politicization and emphasizes the interaction between social structures and citizenship institutions in these processes.

abstract={Time has shown that attempts to transition to democracy in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) following the Arab Uprisings were no minor feat. In their experiments with democratization, MENA countries faced a number of challenges that remain underexplored. Even though each county’s path towards democratic transition is multifaceted and multicausal, in this article we set out to understand why attempts to transition to democracy have largely failed in post-uprising MENA with the unique exception of Tunisia. We do so by examining four post-uprising cases–Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and Yemen–from a comparative perspective focusing on the coercive power of the state. Our findings suggest that in the presence of weak state institutions that lose their monopoly over coercive means that constrain non-state actors, democratization tends to fail. Yet, even if state mechanisms are strong, challenges to democratic transitions can still persist, especially if such states house politically motivated security institutions, such as influential militaries, that favour authoritarian rule. Within the larger picture, this work also provides further inferences about the relationship between structural aspects of the state and processes of democratization. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Elections have been theorized to bolster compliance with authoritarian regimes by strengthening their coercive capacity, their ability to co-opt, and their legitimacy. While a growing body of research supports the coercive and co-optive functions of these elections, there is little systematic empirical evidence regarding elections’ contributions to the legitimacy of autocrats. This article draws on survey data from eight authoritarian countries in the Arab world to show that respondents who perceive elections as freer and fairer are more likely to express acceptance of the regime's right to govern and less likely to participate in political protests, even when they disapprove of the regime's performance. In addition, a survey experiment implemented in Egypt and Morocco provides causal evidence that perceptions of electoral quality impact legitimacy beliefs and expressed willingness to protest. The findings indicate the importance of studying how authoritarian institutions influence popular beliefs about the legitimacy of autocratic rulers. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This article considers the ways in which partisanship structured public attitudes about the United States' multiple governments as each tried to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 during the spring and summer of 2020. The evidence shows that Democrats and Republicans both made distinctions among their local, state, and federal governments, assigning them different functional responsibilities. Yet, members of the two parties did not agree on that division of intergovernmental responsibility. Rather, across a variety of issues, polarized partisan identities structured beliefs about the operation and efficacy of the American federal system's ability to contend with the spread of coronavirus. Moreover, these beliefs did not stem from prior ideological commitments or the different composition of Democratic or Republican communities. Instead, party leaders proved especially capable of shifting public attitudes on questions of federal versus state authority through their shifting rhetoric and strategic framing. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

abstract={Are vote-choice buying attempts successful? Much research across the social sciences argues that political machines expertly turn citizens into clients, undermining core aspects of democracy. Using insights from behavioral theories of vote choice, I argue that standard partisan campaigns can diminish vote-choice buying’s efficiency. Machines face a targeting problem: Local brokers identify good clients using long-term markers but then campaigns shift many citizens’ vote-relevant attitudes in ways that brokers cannot detect, leading to targeting errors. Vote-choice buying remains effective on recipients who are unmoved by the campaigns, but this group is small where campaigns are influential. Tests using panel surveys from Mexico’s 2000 and 2012 elections measure vote-buying attempts with direct questions and list experiments, employ various measures of campaign influence, and rely on new and existing estimation techniques. The findings yield a more optimistic view of the quality of elections in new democracies than current literature implies. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={In an era of increasingly public diplomacy, conventional wisdom assumes that leaders who compromise damage their reputations and lose the respect of their constituents, which undermines the prospects for international peace and cooperation. This article challenges this assumption and tests how leaders can negotiate compromises and avoid paying domestic approval and reputation costs. Drawing on theories of individuals' core values, psychological processes, and partisanship, the author argues that leaders reduce or eliminate domestic public constraints by exercising proposal power and initiating compromises. Employing survey experiments to test how public approval and perceptions of reputation respond to leaders' strategies across security and economic issues, the author finds attitudes toward compromise are conditioned by the ideology of the audience and leader, with audiences of liberals being more supportive of compromise. In the US case, this results in Republican presidents having greater leeway to negotiate compromises. The article's contributions suggest that leaders who exercise proposal power have significant flexibility to negotiate compromise settlements in international bargaining.

abstract={While the presence of a strong civil society is recognized as desirable for democracies, an important question is what motivates citizens to join organizations. This article presents novel experimental evidence on the conditions under which citizens join interest organizations. We presented 1,400 citizens in two Mexican states with fliers promoting a new local interest organization. These fliers contain one of four randomly selected recruitment appeals. We find evidence that both brokerage of state patronage and demand-making for local public goods are effective recruitment appeals. The effect for patronage brokerage is especially pronounced among respondents with prior organizational contact, supporting our hypothesis of a “particularistic socialization” effect wherein organizational experience is associated with greater response to selective material benefits. Our findings suggest that under some conditions, rather than generating norms of other-regarding, interest organizations can reinforce members’ individualistic tendencies. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Violence against women (VAW) is widespread in East Africa, with almost half of married women experiencing physical abuse. Those seeking to address this issue confront two challenges: some forms of domestic violence are widely condoned and it is the norm for witnesses to not report incidents. Building on a growing literature showing that education-entertainment can change norms and behaviors, we present experimental evidence from a media campaign attended by more than 10,000 Ugandans in 112 rural villages. In randomly assigned villages, video dramatizations discouraged VAW and encouraged reporting. Results from interviews conducted several months after the intervention show no change in attitudes condoning VAW yet a substantial increase in willingness to report to authorities, especially among women, and a decline in the share of women who experienced violence. The theoretical implication is that interventions that affect disclosure norms may reduce socially harmful behavior even if they do not reduce its acceptability. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={A hypothesized benefit of decentralization is that it will promote policy experimentation, yet there have been few studies examining this link. in this article, I Identify three pathways through which decentralization could plausibly lead to greater experimentation and empirically assess their presence through an analysis of California's Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), a policy that enhanced the fiscal autonomy of local school districts. I find mixed results; even though there was some evidence to suggest greater policy activity, most new actions taken by school districts were incremental changes. Further, there was little ideological differentiation in adopted policies despite variation in districts' partisan composition. Small districts were slightly more likely to experiment than larger ones, supporting the hypothesis that smaller jurisdictions are more nimble and flexible and thus more likely to enact policy change. I conclude by exploring how the Incentives and preferences of local officials mediate the causal connection between decentralization and policy experimentation. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Although civilians across the globe are fleeing conflict in record numbers, the reality is that far more remain behind. In addition to traditional wars, people stay in territories governed by criminal organizations. How might individuals threatened with displacement by a criminal gang manage to resist? Drawing on intensive participant observation and interviews in marginal neighborhoods of Medellín, Colombia, I argue that the urban residents most likely to remain despite being at risk of displacement are the “well connected.” Despite threats, they leverage ties to a community figure or member of the armed group to stay. I test a number of related hypotheses using an original survey and survey experiment. Unlike other work stressing that residents are trapped by scant resources or remain only by joining local associations or belligerents, my theory reveals residents’ agency and neutrality as they seek safety and security in conditions of state absence. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={How does perceived political corruption affect electoral preferences? Scholarship of Eastern Europe addressed this question primarily through the study of observational data. This study contributes to the existing scholarship by addressing the endogeneity problem and allows to causally interpret effects of perceived corruption on voting intentions. It combines hypotheses tested in earlier studies to investigate the impact of perceived political corruption on different electoral choices. A survey experiment in Hungary shows that exposure to political corruption makes respondents more likely to abstain from voting, less likely to support the incumbent party, and more likely to expect the anti-establishment party to win. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

funding_text 1={The research was carried out on a nationally representative sample of the Hungarian adult population aged 19–64 years. I provide the summary statistics for my two treatment groups in the following section. Several individual-level controls were used for balancing the sample–gender, age and education of the subjects. As Table A1 in Appendix II suggests, the data in both samples appear to be balanced by basic demographic characteristics. The differences in gender, age, and education are not statistically significant across both groups. The results of the manipulation check for two different treatment combinations are presented in Tables A3 and A4 (Appendix II). As one can see from Table A4 in Appendix II, treatment exposure had significantly altered respondents’ views of the political corruption of the parties, as there is a significant increase in perception of the two parties as “equally very corrupt” among the respondents in treatment group by comparison to respondents in control group (41.2%–34.3%) (Tables A3 and A4, Appendix II). Based on the previous data, I conclude that my treatment worked by significantly increasing the respondents’ perception of the corruption of the Hungarian political establishment. The main findings of my analysis are presented in the following tables and graphs. The results of the t-test analysis in Table 1 for the first specification of my dependent variable (“Would you participate in the national elections to Hungarian Parliament if they took place this Sunday?”) suggest that respondents in the treatment group were more likely to abstain from voting. The effect is statistically significant at 95% confidence interval (0.106 versus 0.067, p=.03). This is in line with my theoretical expectations, and that of other scholarship, that associates high levels of perceived corruption with non-participation. Table 1.

Note: General Sample, Binary Data, t-test. The results for the second specification of my dependent variable (Which Party would you vote if the national election took place this Sunday?) are presented as follows: I also plot the results of the previous analysis. For ease of interpretation, Figure 4 reports the findings graphically, with the dots representing the estimated magnitude of the treatment effect on given question of interest and the “whiskers” spanning the 90% confidence interval. Figure 4. Corruption treatment and current voting preferences. Note: General sample, binary data, t-test, 90% confidence interval Corruption treatment and current voting preferences. Note: General sample, binary data, t-test, 90% confidence interval The previous results generally fall in line with my theoretical expectations (Hypotheses I and II). As Table 2 and Figure 4 indicate, I find a statistically significant increase in voting abstention (0.281 versus 0.232, p=0.04) and a decrease in support for the incumbent Fidesz party (0.208 versus 0.267, p=0.02) as result of my treatment. Interestingly, the observed decline in support for another establishment party–MSZP–is much milder and is not statistically significant (0.063 versus 0.069, p=0.35 respectively). This reflects Hypothesis II in so far as that incumbent parties tend to be the ones primarily punished for the perceived corruption of the political establishment. In this specification of the dependent variable, there is a slight increase in support for the anti-establishment Jobbik and increase in support for “other” parties, but none of these are statistically significant.

Note: General Sample, Binary Data, t-test. Next, I proceed to the alternative specification of my dependent variable, which asked the respondents about the prospective winner of the next parliamentary election (Which party do you think would win (if the national elections took place next Sunday)?). The results of the analysis are presented in Table 3. Table 3. Corruption treatment and party expected to win the next election.Which party do you think would win (if the national elections took place this Sunday)?ControlTreatmentT-statisticHa, Pr(T > t)Fidesz0.6870.652t(1008)= 1.204Ha: diff > 0Pr(T > t) = 0.115MSZP0.0480.034t(1008) = 1.116Ha: diff > 0Pr(T > t)= 0.132Jobbik0.1250.174t(1008)= −2.209***Ha: diff < 0Pr(T < t) = 0.014“Politics Can Be Different”, LMP0.0080.012t(1008) = −0.631Ha: diff < 0Pr(T < t) = 0.263“Other” party0.1330.129t(1008) = 0.187Ha: diff > 0Pr(T > t) = 0.426*p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01.Note: General Sample, Binary Data, t-test. *p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01. Note: General Sample, Binary Data, t-test. I also plot the results of the previous analysis. As illustrated in Table 3 and Figure 5, my treatment had a direct effect on respondents’ expectation that Jobbik was more likely to win the next election (0.174 versus 0.125, p=0.01). While the effect size might appear small, in a contested election this change in support for a political party might alternate electoral results. Moreover, internet-based experiments commonly underestimate treatment effects, which appear to be larger using alternative methods. 60 Figure 5. Corruption treatment and the party expected to win the next Election. Note: General sample, binary data, t-test, 90% confidence interval. Corruption treatment and the party expected to win the next Election. Note: General sample, binary data, t-test, 90% confidence interval. There is also some decrease in the expected electoral success of Fidesz (0.652 versus 0.687, p=0.12). Hence voters exposed to corruption treatment were more likely to believe that Fidesz would lose the next election (although the effect is not statistically significant), which is consistent with the earlier finding on the negative impact of the treatment on Fidesz support (see Figure 4). Voters who were in the treatment group were also significantly more likely to believe that Jobbik will win the next election (even if my treatment never explicitly mentioned or referenced Jobbik). Notice also that the effects of my treatment on support for remaining parties are negligible (0.012 versus 0.008, p=0.26 for the green LMP, and 0.129 versus 0.133, p=0.43 for “Other” party respectively). In this sense, it is plausible to conclude that Jobbik, as the party that actively politicizes the anti-establishment agenda, allows respondents to express a protest vote when they perceive political corruption as increasing. Overall, the results of my experiment are in line with my theoretical expectations. I find that the increase in the perceived corruption of the political establishment significantly increased electoral abstention, decreased support for the incumbent party, Fidesz, and also increased the belief that the anti-establishment Jobbik party will win the next Hungarian election among the respondents. The latter finding may be indicative of the preferences of respondents who are undecided or not willing to directly reveal their voting intentions and it suggests that the ability of Hungary’s parties to draw attention to corruption scandals in the future might alternate the country’s political landscape. In November 2017 I ran an internet-based experimental survey in Hungary of a total size of 1010 participants (505 respondents for treatment and control groups respectively). The subjects were randomly recruited from a representative sample of Hungary’s population by professional polling company, Solid Data. The administered treatment primed respondents about the corruption of Hungary’s political establishment. The treated group was shown a video resembling a Hungarian cable TV news broadcast. The host in the studio showed several pictures presented as results of (real) Hungarian surveys, which demonstrated that the majority of Hungarians viewed the level of corruption of the political establishment as high and the ruling Fidesz party as just as corrupt as the MSZP, which was in power until 2010 (see Appendix I). The video also contained two street interviews with “ordinary Hungarians” (played by professional actors) who complained about the corruption of Hungarian politicians. The video referenced politicians belonging to Hungary’s major political parties–the right-wing Fidesz and the left-wing MSZP, the only two parties to rule the country following Hungary’s democratic transition. The video presented both establishment Fidesz and MSZP as equally corrupt but did not mention Jobbik or any other Hungarian party. The control group was shown a video of neutral content Figure 3.

After watching this video, please answer the questions. Examples of information provided in the treatment group video. Note: The inscription before the video said_ now let's look at the video below. After watching this video, please answer the questions. For the purposes of my experiment, I have included a manipulation check, asking the respondents what they thought about the corruption of two establishment parties, Fidesz and MSZP. In line with the information presented to the treatment group, my expectation was that treatment exposure will increase respondents’ belief that both mainstream parties are equally very corrupt. What do you think about the corruption of Fidesz and MSZP parties? Both are equally somewhat corruptBoth are equally very corruptFidesz is more corrupt than MSZPMSZP is more corrupt than FideszBoth parties are likely not corrupt Both are equally somewhat corrupt Both are equally very corrupt Fidesz is more corrupt than MSZP MSZP is more corrupt than Fidesz Both parties are likely not corrupt I used several specifications of my dependent variables. To address Hypothesis I, the question asked whether the respondents were inclined to participate in the upcoming election: Would you participate in the national elections to Hungarian Parliament if they took place this Sunday? YesNoI don’t know Yes No I don’t know To address Hypothesis II and III, the next question asked about respondents’ vote preferences. For simplicity, only the major parties represented in the Hungarian parliament at the time of the survey were directly referenced in the question, while respondents who wished to name smaller parties were provided with the option “Other”. Which Party would you vote for if the national election took place this Sunday? AbstainFidesz, Hungarian Civic AllianceJobbik, Movement for Better HungaryMSzP, Hungarian Socialist PartyLMP, Politics Can Be DifferentOther Abstain Fidesz, Hungarian Civic Alliance Jobbik, Movement for Better Hungary MSzP, Hungarian Socialist Party LMP, Politics Can Be Different Other An alternative (less direct) way of asking respondents about their voting intentions is by asking about their voting expectations. Respondents often forecast which party will win a given election with a remarkable degree of accuracy. 55 Such forecasts usually are even better at identifying the winning party than direct voting intention polls. 56 For example, on a national-level, survey data collected before seven US presidential elections 1988–2012, Graefe found that citizen forecasts are better than any other approach at forecasting both election winners and their vote shares. 57 Similarly, Murr et al. who used national-level data before each of the 18 British general elections 1950–2015 found that citizen forecasts are better than voter intentions at forecasting both the winning party and its seat share. 58 Two reasons may account for this phenomenon. Firstly, expectations tend to incorporate more information than intentions as they capture information about one’s own and other people’s voting preferences, along with the information from other sources. Secondly, expectation forecasts include responses from people who do not vote, who are still undecided, and do not wish to reveal for whom they will vote. 59 In particular, this formulation would allow respondents to express their preferences for Jobbik in a less direct way. The last consideration makes it a particularly applicable framework for measuring respondents’ preferences for the anti-establishment parties, since such parties commonly combine anti-establishment rhetoric with extremist positions on other issues. It allows respondents who would otherwise be reluctant to expose their support for such parties, to preserve confidentiality and anonymity while reporting their voting intentions.

Formed in 2003, Jobbik managed to win over almost one million Hungarian voters in 2010 election, doubling the number that voted for the party to the European Parliament in 2009. In the subsequent national parliamentary elections of 2014 and 2018, Jobbik received 20.2% and 19.1% of the vote respectively. Since 2014 Jobbik has become the third political power in the country. The anti-establishment nature of Jobbik is manifested through consistent references to the divide between allegedly corrupt political elites and “ordinary people” in its rhetoric. From the start of its campaign, Jobbik sought to create a rift between the mainstream parties and voters by arguing that opportunism, lies and corruption were rampant in Hungary’s national politics. 44 Figure 2 pictures the salience of anti-establishment and anti-elite discourse for main Hungarian parties using the available evidence from the Chapel Hill dataset for the years of 2014 and 2017. It is a continuous variable with a value of “0” corresponding to the minimal importance of anti-establishment and anti-elite rhetoric, and “10” corresponding to extreme importance of anti-establishment rhetoric. 45 Figure 2 demonstrates that throughout this period the salience of anti-establishment rhetoric was much higher for Jobbik compared to other Hungarian political parties. Figure 2. Salience of anti-establishment and anti-elite rhetoric for political Parties in Hungary. Note: Chapel Hill Dataset, 2014 and 2017. Salience of anti-establishment and anti-elite rhetoric for political Parties in Hungary. Note: Chapel Hill Dataset, 2014 and 2017. In its manifestos, Jobbik repeatedly used the term “criminal politicians” to denounce the Hungarian political establishment for serving private interests and failing to respond to the popular demand for transparency. Jobbik's manifestos also hint at an existence of an illegitimate relationship between the political elites and private entrepreneurs during the privatization process and argue that political and economic crimes compromised the good of the Hungarian nation to the benefit of the corrupt elite. 46 To address this problem, Jobbik offers to remove Hungary’s current politicians, to put an end to criminality in politics, to reform the regulations of public procurement and to review all major state investment projects and past privatization deals. 47 Jobbik also offers to enhance the principle of accountability by lifting the immunity of MPs and introducing political crime as a new category. 48 While accusing all of the broadly defined elites of political corruption, the Jobbik party discourse tended to adjust specific targets of its political attacks depending on political context. For example, in its 2010 electoral campaign, Jobbik described both mainstream political parties as equally criminal: “Neither the political crimes of the carnation < the emblem of the MSZP>, nor the orange < the emblem of Fidesz> … can continue to remain unanswered any longer”. 49 However, at the time, the specific target of its attack was the then-incumbent left MSZP party, which by 2010 became involved in a number of corruption scandals. 50 Following the 2010 election, Jobbik entered the Hungarian Parliament. To maintain credibility among its supporters, the party now consistently needed to furnish proof that it did not belong to the “corrupt elite”. To achieve this goal, Jobbik leaders concentrated on directly attacking the incumbent Fidesz party and focusing attention on corruption scandals around it. 51 The salience of the issue of corruption for the Jobbik party grew over the years. As the ruling party, Fidesz, which flirted with nativist and anti-immigration sentiments, moved ideologically closer to Jobbik, the latter still preserved the comparative advantage of representing the largely untainted anti-establishment platform. After 2014, in an effort to move away from Fidesz, the Jobbik party, previously known for xenophobic and anti-Semitic views, shifted to the centre of the political spectrum to pitch itself as a more centrist, “people’s party” alternative to the Fidesz party. 52 While abandoning its extremist narratives, Jobbik made a particular emphasis on attacking corruption in Hungary. This strategy has been facilitated by multiplying corruption scandals involving representatives of the Fidesz party. One of them involving EU funds and the Fidesz Prime Minister’s son-in-law drew particular attention from opposition media. 53 Over the years, the party also promoted anti-corruption legislation. For example, in 2017, as a result of Jobbik’s proposal, the Hungarian parliament unanimously voted to extend the statute of limitations for corruption cases to 12 years. The issue of political corruption has become centrepiece of Jobbik’s 2018 electoral campaign. Throughout all of 2017, the party labelled Fidesz politicians as thieves on billboards around Hungary. The 2018 party manifesto named corruption the plague of the political sphere, deliberately promoted by Hungary’s political establishment. 54 In response, Jobbik offered to classify corruption crimes as an aggravated felony entailing the most severe sanctions. Overall, the salience of the corruption issue for Jobbik remained high over time. How do voters respond to the perceived political corruption of their country’s political establishment? As discussed previously, most of the earlier work on the effects of perceived political corruption on support for anti-establishment parties has relied on cross-sectional data, which makes establishing causality difficult. Observational studies do not address the problem of third variables and spurious relationships. The time-lags between changes in party policy positions, people’s perceptions of those changes and measurements of those perceptions further complicate the possibility to address these questions on observational studies. To address these concerns, I ran an experimental survey in Hungary, a country with a successful anti-establishment party (Jobbik, Movement for a Better Hungary) that systematically uses anti-corruption slogans in its platform. The experimental setting allows me to address the causality in a more systematic way, by controlling the effects of direct treatment exposure while holding other variables constant. 43 Formed in 2003, Jobbik managed to win over almost one million Hungarian voters in 2010 election, doubling the number that voted for the party to the European Parliament in 2009. In the subsequent national parliamentary elections of 2014 and 2018, Jobbik received 20.2% and 19.1% of the vote respectively. Since 2014 Jobbik has become the third political power in the country. The anti-establishment nature of Jobbik is manifested through consistent references to the divide between allegedly corrupt political elites and “ordinary people” in its rhetoric.

For example, in its 2010 electoral campaign, Jobbik described both mainstream political parties as equally criminal: “Neither the political crimes of the carnation < the emblem of the MSZP>, nor the orange < the emblem of Fidesz> … can continue to remain unanswered any longer”. 49 However, at the time, the specific target of its attack was the then-incumbent left MSZP party, which by 2010 became involved in a number of corruption scandals. 50 Following the 2010 election, Jobbik entered the Hungarian Parliament. To maintain credibility among its supporters, the party now consistently needed to furnish proof that it did not belong to the “corrupt elite”. To achieve this goal, Jobbik leaders concentrated on directly attacking the incumbent Fidesz party and focusing attention on corruption scandals around it. 51 The salience of the issue of corruption for the Jobbik party grew over the years. As the ruling party, Fidesz, which flirted with nativist and anti-immigration sentiments, moved ideologically closer to Jobbik, the latter still preserved the comparative advantage of representing the largely untainted anti-establishment platform. After 2014, in an effort to move away from Fidesz, the Jobbik party, previously known for xenophobic and anti-Semitic views, shifted to the centre of the political spectrum to pitch itself as a more centrist, “people’s party” alternative to the Fidesz party. 52 While abandoning its extremist narratives, Jobbik made a particular emphasis on attacking corruption in Hungary. This strategy has been facilitated by multiplying corruption scandals involving representatives of the Fidesz party. One of them involving EU funds and the Fidesz Prime Minister’s son-in-law drew particular attention from opposition media. 53 Over the years, the party also promoted anti-corruption legislation. For example, in 2017, as a result of Jobbik’s proposal, the Hungarian parliament unanimously voted to extend the statute of limitations for corruption cases to 12 years. The issue of political corruption has become centrepiece of Jobbik’s 2018 electoral campaign. Throughout all of 2017, the party labelled Fidesz politicians as thieves on billboards around Hungary. The 2018 party manifesto named corruption the plague of the political sphere, deliberately promoted by Hungary’s political establishment. 54 In response, Jobbik offered to classify corruption crimes as an aggravated felony entailing the most severe sanctions. Overall, the salience of the corruption issue for Jobbik remained high over time. In November 2017 I ran an internet-based experimental survey in Hungary of a total size of 1010 participants (505 respondents for treatment and control groups respectively). The subjects were randomly recruited from a representative sample of Hungary’s population by professional polling company, Solid Data. The administered treatment primed respondents about the corruption of Hungary’s political establishment. The treated group was shown a video resembling a Hungarian cable TV news broadcast. The host in the studio showed several pictures presented as results of (real) Hungarian surveys, which demonstrated that the majority of Hungarians viewed the level of corruption of the political establishment as high and the ruling Fidesz party as just as corrupt as the MSZP, which was in power until 2010 (see Appendix I). The video also contained two street interviews with “ordinary Hungarians” (played by professional actors) who complained about the corruption of Hungarian politicians. The video referenced politicians belonging to Hungary’s major political parties–the right-wing Fidesz and the left-wing MSZP, the only two parties to rule the country following Hungary’s democratic transition. The video presented both establishment Fidesz and MSZP as equally corrupt but did not mention Jobbik or any other Hungarian party. The control group was shown a video of neutral content Figure 3. Figure 3. Examples of information provided in the treatment group video. Note: The inscription before the video said_ now let's look at the video below. After watching this video, please answer the questions. For the purposes of my experiment, I have included a manipulation check, asking the respondents what they thought about the corruption of two establishment parties, Fidesz and MSZP. In line with the information presented to the treatment group, my expectation was that treatment exposure will increase respondents’ belief that both mainstream parties are equally very corrupt. What do you think about the corruption of Fidesz and MSZP parties? Both are equally somewhat corruptBoth are equally very corruptFidesz is more corrupt than MSZPMSZP is more corrupt than FideszBoth parties are likely not corrupt I used several specifications of my dependent variables. To address Hypothesis I, the question asked whether the respondents were inclined to participate in the upcoming election: Would you participate in the national elections to Hungarian Parliament if they took place this Sunday? YesNoI don’t know To address Hypothesis II and III, the next question asked about respondents’ vote preferences. For simplicity, only the major parties represented in the Hungarian parliament at the time of the survey were directly referenced in the question, while respondents who wished to name smaller parties were provided with the option “Other”. Which Party would you vote for if the national election took place this Sunday? AbstainFidesz, Hungarian Civic AllianceJobbik, Movement for Better HungaryMSzP, Hungarian Socialist PartyLMP, Politics Can Be DifferentOther An alternative (less direct) way of asking respondents about their voting intentions is by asking about their voting expectations. Respondents often forecast which party will win a given election with a remarkable degree of accuracy. 55 Such forecasts usually are even better at identifying the winning party than direct voting intention polls. 56 For example, on a national-level, survey data collected before seven US presidential elections 1988–2012, Graefe found that citizen forecasts are better than any other approach at forecasting both election winners and their vote shares. 57 Similarly, Murr et al. who used national-level data before each of the 18 British general elections 1950–2015 found that citizen forecasts are better than voter intentions at forecasting both the winning party and its seat share. 58 Two reasons may account for this phenomenon. Firstly, expectations tend to incorporate more information than intentions as they capture information about one’s own and other people’s voting preferences, along with the information from other sources. Secondly, expectation forecasts include responses from people who do not vote, who are still undecided, and do not wish to reveal for whom they will vote. 59 In particular, this formulation would allow respondents to express their preferences for Jobbik in a less direct way. The last consideration makes it a particularly applicable framework for measuring respondents’ preferences for the anti-establishment parties, since such parties commonly combine anti-establishment rhetoric with extremist positions on other issues. It allows respondents who would otherwise be reluctant to expose their support for such parties, to preserve confidentiality and anonymity while reporting their voting intentions. Which party do you think would win (if the national elections took place next Sunday)? Fidesz, Hungarian Civic AllianceJobbik, Movement for Better HungaryMSzP, Hungarian Socialist PartyPolitics Can Be Different, LMPOther The results of analysis are presented in the following section. Political corruption can be defined as the illegal abuse of public office and authority for personal gain or for the benefit of third parties. 19 Putnam famously argued that civic engagement requires a community in which leaders are and “conceive themselves to be, responsible to their fellow citizens”. 20 The deleterious effect of perceived political corruption works by undermining the public’s belief in the accountability and responsibility of the elites. What are the possible electoral choices available to citizens in view of widespread political corruption? Applying Hirschman's theory to politics, when citizens believe that their state exhibits a decrease in quality of governance they have two possible responses: they can exit (withdraw from the relationship), which translates into abstaining from electoral participation; or they can voice their issue (attempt to repair or improve the relationship), which manifests into voting out the incumbent and/or voting in the opposition parties. 21 Both types of behaviour have been discussed in the literature on political corruption. Firstly, studies have demonstrated that perceptions of increasing political corruption suppress democratic participation and decrease electoral turnout. 22 By this logic, corruption undermines citizens’ faith in their political leaders, making these citizens less likely to partake in the democratic process. 23 Citizens who perceive corruption as increasing tend to abstain from voting in varying regional contexts as different as Mexico, 24 Latin American democracies 25 and non-democratic countries. 26 While the impact of political corruption scandals on voter turnout is less pronounced in more stable Western democracies, 27 in less established Eastern European democracies where parties are not well rooted in society and the public lacks experience with democratic procedures to hold the ruling elite accountable, voting abstention may be a more attractive and costless choice for citizens. 28 Hence, I hypothesize that voters who perceive a high level of political corruption may become more inclined to abstain from participating in elections. Hypothesis I: Respondents who perceive the level of political corruption as high are more likely to abstain from voting. Hypothesis I: Respondents who perceive the level of political corruption as high are more likely to abstain from voting. Secondly, while perceptions of corruption may make some voters “exit the system” (abstain from voting), they may mobilize others to vote against the corrupt elites. Kostadinova finds that while perceptions of widespread corruption discourage some voters in post-Communist countries, they mobilize others to “voice” their discontent. 29 Citizens who cannot trust their national representatives because they demand bribes have fewer incentives to interact with their elected politicians. The information about political corruption may thus decrease support of incumbent politicians. Scholars link perceived corruption and the politicization of corruption to anti-incumbent voting. 30 This also holds true in volatile party systems of Eastern Europe, where protest voting to punish unpopular incumbents has been a widespread practice. 31 In line with the previous reasoning, I theorize that perceptions of political corruption have negative impact on support for the ruling parties. Hence my first theoretical expectation is that: Hypothesis II: Respondents who view the level of political corruption as high are less likely to support the incumbent political party. Hypothesis II: Respondents who view the level of political corruption as high are less likely to support the incumbent political party. While perceived political corruption may decrease support for allegedly corrupt incumbents, it may also make voters more likely to support opposition parties that politicize the issue of political corruption. In fact, Davis et al. argue that perceptions of corruption can play a key role in the decision of government supporters to switch to another party. 32 Aderberg argues that voters punish political corruption when a clean political alternative exists; otherwise they are more likely to tolerate an allegedly corrupt candidate. 33 Which parties are such voters more likely to support? One particular group of parties that tends to benefit from politicization of corruption are anti-establishment parties. 34 Parties engaging in anti-establishment rhetoric explicitly identify with “ordinary people” and contrast themselves against a separate and coherent “political class” that is composed of all political opponents undifferentiated by party affiliation and may also include economic, intellectual and/or international elites. 35 These parties emphasize a fundamental divide between the people and the political establishment and see themselves as challengers to the ruling elites. 36 The use of anti-corruption slogans is directly linked to the anti-establishment nature of these parties. Emphasizing “corruption” serves these parties as the main vehicle to frame the political world in dualist terms–the “good” people against the “bad” elite and helps benefit from the loss in trust in political establishment. 37 Not surprisingly, rising corruption is the most common driver of the breakthrough of anti-establishment parties, albeit refracted through sets of economic and party-political circumstances. 38 Given the high salience of corruption in the post-Communist context, the anti-establishment parties often resort to the use of such rhetoric. In the post-Communist context, the issue of corruption also often serves to advocate a rupture from the Communist past. Following the collapse of the communist bloc, the political elites of the previous regime often preserved much of their influence through communist successor parties. 39 Since many of the party elites in the region were drawn from nomenklatura structures of the Communist regime, the opposition parties commonly held these parties responsible for corruption in relation to privatization of national assets. 40 Because of their populations’ frustration with communism, the radical left parties in Eastern European countries tended to stay marginal and were unable to exploit the anti-establishment sentiment. 41 Instead, the parties that used this agenda primarily emerged on the right side of the political spectrum. These observations explain why the anti-establishment parties in the Eastern Europe commonly resort to the use of such rhetoric, and why they are often found on the right side of the political spectrum. The rest of the study builds upon these findings. I theorize that: Hypothesis III: Respondents who view the level of political corruption as high are more likely to support anti-establishment parties. 42 Hypothesis III: Respondents who view the level of political corruption as high are more likely to support anti-establishment parties. 42 While available empirical literature has contributed to our understanding of the relationship between political corruption and electoral preferences, the inherent limitation of measuring consequences of the exposure of corruption makes it hard to establish a causal relationship. Does the respondents’ exposure to corruption drive their electoral behaviour? Or are those respondents already sceptical of the political establishment more likely to describe political corruption as high? In particular, supporters of the anti-establishment parties may be more likely to report higher perceived corruption by simply repeating the message espoused by these political actors. The very acquisition of information about corruption may be endogenous to electoral choices. Most scholarship on Eastern Europe approaches these questions through the study of observational data and is unable to disentangle causal effects. My article fills in this gap in the literature. It is based on data from a unique experimental survey in which respondents were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Such an approach allows to better establish causality between treatment exposure and subsequent changes in voting intentions. Do perceptions of political corruption play a significant role in electoral choices? Scholarship on corruption has discovered several effects of political corruption on voting intentions. Firstly, perception of widespread political corruption may undermine trust in democratic institutions and decrease electoral participation and turnout. Additionally, corruption may also contribute to anti-incumbent mobilization and give advantage to opposition parties. However, the existing evidence for the impact of perceptions of corruption on voting preferences remains primarily observational in nature, 1 which makes it hard to establish a causal relationship. Moreover, few studies analyse the impact of perceived corruption on different voting strategies simultaneously. The impact of perceived corruption on support for anti-establishment parties is also often ignored, despite the fact that such parties commonly politicize the issue of corruption through their political platforms by contrasting “the pure people” against “the corrupt elite”. 2 This article fills that gap by exploring how perceived political corruption influences voting intentions. I ran an experimental survey in Hungary, which allowed addressing the limitations of observational studies (specifically, the endogeneity problem) and establish a clearer causal effect of perceived political corruption on voting attitudes. 3 I show that the perceived corruption of the political establishment tends to fuel voter abstention and decrease support for the incumbent party, while also finding some evidence of increased support for the anti-establishment party. Eastern Europe represents a particularly good testing opportunity for these questions. The countries of the region suffer from widespread political corruption at the highest levels of government. Corruption is a considerably more salient issue in Eastern Europe than in Western Europe. 4 Due to a strong association between levels of corruption and corruption allegations, 5 this issue is more likely to come up during the elections. Between 2000 and 2010 corruption and related scandals were a major issue in 28 elections, or 70% of the elections in this region. 6 Less stable democracies may be particularly susceptible to the negative effects of corruption because their citizens suffer from difficult economic conditions and are more likely to feel betrayed by the politicians, who they view as stealing from the state. 7 From this perspective, Eastern Europe provides a particularly prolific ground for testing my hypotheses. While the region suffers from widespread political corruption, conventional explanations for the rise of anti-establishment parties, such as an anti-immigration sentiment, 8 are less applicable in Eastern European context. The region historically supplied rather than received migrants, and here the 2014 migrant crisis followed rather than preceded the rise of these parties. 9 Bustikova argues that until 2015, anti-establishment populist parties in Eastern Europe had never effectively mobilized against the new minorities arriving from the non-European countries. 10 Allen shows that the link between the anti-immigrant attitudes and support for anti-establishment parties has been historically weaker in Eastern Europe than in Western Europe. 11 Hence other factors may better explain the success of these parties in the region. Hungary is one of the Eastern European countries most tainted by corruption. 12 By 2018, Hungary had fallen ten points on the corruption perception index in six years, 13 meaning that perceptions about corruption have worsened dramatically over this period. As a result, Hungary has the highest corruption perception score in the European Union besides Bulgaria. Figure 1 compares the dynamic of the perception of corruption in Hungary over the period of 2012–2017 against the European Union average. The Corruption Perception Index, which ranks countries by their perceived levels of public sector corruption according to experts and businesspeople, uses a scale of 0–100, where 0 is highly corrupt and 100 is very clean.

The case of Hungary is useful for analysing the relationship between corruption perceptions and support for anti-establishment parties. First, defining “establishment” parties is easier in the Hungarian case, since, until recently, Hungary had a de facto two-party system with two parties alternating in power: the right-conservative Fidesz and the left MSZP. Both MSZP and Fidesz, which has been in power since 2010, have been accused of major corruption scandals. Government-related corruption cases have drawn widespread media attention in Hungary and recently might have contributed to the decrease in popularity of the incumbent, Fidesz. For example, the significant losses incurred by Fidesz in the 2019 local election have been linked to the leaked video of Zsolt Borkai, which garnered considerable public interest. The Fidesz-backed incumbent mayor of Gyor, who was running for re-election, was caught on video participating in a drug-fuelled party on a yacht, allegedly paid for with government money. Secondly, Hungary features one of the most successful anti-establishment parties in the region, the Jobbik party, which was able to mobilize more than 10% of voters in each of the three consecutive national elections in 2010, 2014 and 2018. 14 Jobbik frequently resorts to the use of anti-corruption rhetoric and made the topic of corruption a centrepiece of its election campaigns. The relationship between perceived political corruption and support for Jobbik in Hungary hence constitutes an interesting research question. This study contributes to the existing scholarship in several respects. Firstly, prior studies tended to either investigate the link between perceived political corruption and incumbent support, 15 or between political corruption and voter turnout. 16 I combine these approaches by testing these hypotheses simultaneously. Secondly, while studies have examined a number of causes related to the rise of anti-establishment parties, perception of corruption remains an important, yet often overlooked source of their popularity. 17 My article addresses this gap by examining the role of perceptions of corruption in support for anti-establishment parties. Thirdly, most of the studies on the topic are observational in nature. My approach addresses the endogeneity problem and fills in the gap in the existing literature by implementing a survey experiment. This approach permits causal analysis of the effect of perceived political corruption on voting intentions. 18 The rest of this article proceeds as follows: firstly, I set out the theoretical framework of my analysis by summarizing the findings of previous studies and formulating testable hypotheses, and I discuss the reasons why the anti-establishment parties of the region embrace the anti-corruption rhetoric; secondly, I describe the research design and results of my experimental survey in Hungary, a country whose anti-establishment Jobbik party has actively used the anti-corruption message in its campaigns; finally, I summarize the findings from the previous sections and suggest further directions in the concluding part of this article.},

abstract={Does an individual’s exposure to aspects of globalization impact their willingness to redistribute to the poor? We hypothesize that the “glitter” of foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing countries leads relatively better-off citizens to perceive that the poor now have more opportunities and are thereby less deserving of help. Findings from an experiment across three states in India reveal that subjects lower their financial support for the poor upon learning a foreign firm in a low-skilled sector is located in the vicinity. Text analysis of subjects’ responses supports the mechanism underlying our hypothesis: FDI reduces support for redistribution when subjects believe that foreign firms offer the uneducated poor higher wages and increased job opportunities. © The Author(s) 2020.},

Tunisia followed this trend by instating a youth quota after undergoing a youth-led democratic revolution in 2011. This subsequently led to youth representing 52% of the candidates (aged 18–35) in the 2018 municipal elections. However, it has yet to be tested whether a candidate’s age matters when evaluating politicians and casting a ballot in elections among Tunisian voters. This article explores the link between age and candidate evaluations which has been largely understudied in the political behaviour literature. Using an original survey experiment fielded in Tunisia, I run a series of regressions that model the relationship between several age treatments and candidate evaluations. Overall, I find that most Tunisians do not use age as a heuristic cue when evaluating political candidates running for office with the exception of the oldest voters who tend to prefer a candidate that is in their 50s. These results showcase the potential limitations of youth quotas serving as a mechanism ascertaining governmental legitimacy in the eyes of young people. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Local public goods and social services are delivered through a variety of funding and implementing channels in aid-dependent countries. Existing research proposes that international aid to governments undermines government legitimacy and the fiscal contract between citizens and their rulers. We outline how the implications of fiscal contract theory differ depending on whether aid takes the form of donors funding projects through the government, donors funding projects through NGOs, or the government outsourcing project implementation to NGOs. We test these predictions using an informational experiment among N = 2446 Ugandan adults in 18 communities with foreign-funded, NGO-implemented projects. We randomize the amount of information that we provide about these projects. Our results suggest that donor-to-government funding has limited effects on citizens’ opinions about their government. Only bypass aid (i.e., donor aid to NGOs) undermines citizens’ assessments of government performance, while only NGO implementation reduces the willingness of citizens to pay fees to the government or to donate to community funds. Government legitimacy, as measured by individuals’ willingness to comply with government instructions, is very low to begin with and is not influenced by information about different forms of aid. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Scholars have long argued that government spending crowds out contributions to public goods through taxes or through nonprofit organizations. In developing countries where public goods are often financed by foreign donors, foreign aid may have a similar inhibiting effect. Aid, it is argued, leads citizens to question the legitimacy of their state and reduces their willingness to comply with taxes. Recent studies show that externally funded non-government organizations and programs fail to catalyze collective action as expected. Bringing together these strands of research, we examine whether information on government and/or foreign financing crowds out willingness to contribute to public goods, and explore mechanisms linking the information and individuals’ responses. Using a survey experiment on elite university students in the Philippines, we find that both government spending and foreign aid reduce willingness to contribute to the public good, albeit not uniformly across different modes of engagement. Moreover, we find that individuals are likely to reduce their contributions, not because they view government and foreign financing as perfect substitutes for their contributions, as the classic crowding out thesis suggests, but because they have little confidence that existing resources will be properly disbursed. Our results point to a general lack of confidence in the state as well as other intermediary institutions involved in the implementation of government and aid programs. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Why do drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) sometimes prey on the communities in which they operate but sometimes provide assistance to these communities? What explains their strategies of extortion and co-optation toward civil society? Using new survey data from Mexico, including list experiments to elicit responses about potentially illegal behavior, this article measures the prevalence of extortion and assistance among DTOs. In support of our theory, these data show that territorial contestation among rival organizations produces more extortion and, in contrast, DTOs provide more assistance when they have monopoly control over a turf. The article uncovers other factors that also shape DTOs’ strategies toward the population, including the degree of collaboration with the state, leadership stability and DTO organization, and the value and logistics of the local criminal enterprise. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={How does political polarization occur under repressive conditions? Drawing on psychological theories of social identity, the author posits that the nature of repression drives polarization. Repression alters group identities, changing the perceived distance between groups and ultimately shaping the level of affective and preference polarization between them through differentiation processes. The author tests the proposed causal relationship using mixed-method data and analysis.The results of a laboratory experiment reveal that exposure to a targeted repression prime results in greater in-group identification and polarization between groups, whereas exposure to a widespread prime results in decreased levels of these same measurements. The effect of the primes appears to be mediated through group identification. Case-study evidence of polarization between political opposition groups that were differently repressed in Egypt and Tunisia reinforces these results. The findings have implications for understanding how polarization, as conditioned by repression, may alter the likelihood of the cooperative behavior among opposition actors necessary for the success of democratic politics. © Trustees of Princeton University 2020.},

abstract={How do voters evaluate women candidates in places where traditional gender norms are strong? We conduct a survey experiment in Malawi to assess both whether citizens discriminate against women candidates and how other salient candidate characteristics—political experience, family status, policy focus, and gendered kinship practices—interact with candidate gender to affect citizen support. Contrary to our expectations, we find citizens prefer women candidates ceteris paribus, and women and men with the same traits are evaluated similarly. Yet, we find two unexpected ways women candidates are disadvantaged in the electoral process. First, we find that citizens prefer candidates who are married with young children, a profile much more common among men than women candidates in practice. Second, we find pervasive qualitative reports of negative campaigning that likely affected citizens’ evaluations of actual women candidates, while not affecting evaluations of hypothetical candidates. We discuss how our results speak to the ways gender biases operate in practice across political contexts. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Discussion is often celebrated as a critical element of public opinion and political participation. Recently, scholars have suggested that the design and features of specific online platforms shape what is politically expressed online and how. Building on these findings and drawing on 112 semi-structured qualitative interviews with information technology experts and internet users, we explain how major Chinese social media platforms differ in structure and motivation. Drawing upon a nationwide representative survey and an online experiment, we find that platforms aiming to make users a source of information through public, information-centred communication, such as the Twitter-like Weibo, are more conducive to political expression; while platforms built to optimize building social connections through private, user-centred communication, such as WhatsApp and Facebook-like WeChat, tend to inhibit political expression. These technological design effects are stronger when users believe the authoritarian state tolerates discussion, but less important when political talk is sensitive. The findings contribute to the debate on the political consequences of the internet by specifying technological and political conditions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Surveys show that citizens in all parts of the world have a strong distaste for corruption. At the same time, and contrary to the predictions of democratic theory, politicians involved in the most glaring abuse of public office often continue to receive electoral support. Using an original survey experiment conducted in Spain, this article explores a previously understudied aspect of this apparent paradox: the importance of viable and clean political alternatives. The results suggest that voters do punish political corruption when a clean alternative exists, even when the corrupt candidate is very appealing in other respects. However, when only given corrupt alternatives, respondents become much more likely to tolerate a candidate accused of corruption—even when given a convenient “no-choice” option. I discuss how these results can help us understand corruption voting and why some societies seem to be stuck in a high-corruption equilibrium. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Under what conditions do elections produce racially discriminatory outcomes? This article proposes electoral discrimination as an electoral mechanism for racial marginalization in indigenous and Afro-descendant Latin America. Electoral discrimination occurs when voters are mobilized under differential terms of electoral inclusion based on their observable characteristics. Using the 2010-2014 rounds of the AmericasBarometer and a conjoint experiment, the author finds that skin color is a robust predictor of vote buying across countries in the region with large, visible black and indigenous populations. A significant portion of the relationship between skin color and vote buying is due to the disproportionate impacts of race-neutral targeting criteria on dark-skinned voters. Observed differences in wealth, political and civic engagement, partisanship, political interest, interpersonal trust, and geography together explain a portion of the skin color-client gap, although the individual contribution of each of these factors differs by country. In addition, the author finds an independent relationship between skin color and vote buying over and above these race-neutral factors. The argument and findings in this article speak broadly to the consequences of electoral mobilization in ethnoracially stratified states in Latin America and beyond.

abstract={A growing number of scholars have documented how social identities defined by an attachment to place influence individuals' understandings about political power and representation. Drawing on this theoretical framework, we explore how place-based identities matter forAmerican federalism by documenting how attachments to the American states alter individuals' decisions to leave, or exit, as well as to welcome newcomers into their local communities. Using a set of conjoint experiments designed to measure individual attitudes about place, politics, and America's federal polity, we find evidence that Americans hold deep and consequential attitudes about the places in which they live. Our evidence confirms that state identities are still highly relevant in shaping American federalism and the competitive pressures between intergovernmental jurisdictions. While federalism may encourage individuals to leave, federalism also nourishes place-specific attachments, motivating people to stay. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={The unfettered expression of electoral choice is an important democratic right; however, in many contexts voters are pressured by others to cast their votes in certain ways. Electoral coercion is a topic that has received increased attention from researchers in recent years as part of the wave of research on electoral violence, yet there is little consensus in the literature as to who the targets of coercion are most likely to be. This article uses a list experiment embedded in a survey fielded following the Turkish general election of 2018 to identify the targets of coercive electoral practices within families and among close friends. The analysis reveals familial electoral coercion to be strongly conditioned by partisanship and disadvantaged demographic characteristics, but finds no evidence that women are more likely than men to be coerced. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Governments often fulfill election pledges to remain in power; yet, it is unclear how pledge fulfillment and breakage actually affect public support for government. This article explores the tendency for governments to be penalized for unfulfilled pledges more than they are rewarded for fulfilled pledges. In two large-scale highly realistic online survey experiments (N = 13,000, 10,000), performed at the beginning and middle of a government’s term in office, respondents are presented with a range of (real) election pledges. We find that broken pledges often are more important to government evaluations than fulfilled pledges, and that pledge fulfillment can produce decreases in support from nonsupporters that more than offset the marginal gains among supporters. Findings provide valuable evidence on asymmetries in political behavior, and a unique account of the “cost of ruling,” the seemingly inevitable tendency for governments to lose support during their time in office. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={The “youth bulge” in developing countries means that we need to pay close attention to how young people want to be governed. That need is particularly great in developing countries that are also deeply divided. But in divided societies, conventional opinion polls often do not suffice, yielding shallow opinions hostage to elite machinations and mutual mistrust. To shed light on what young people would want if they had a chance to learn and deliberate about the issues, we follow a survey with an intensive deliberative field experiment in one such society–Kirkuk. Contrary to widespread concerns about the predominance of ethnic interests, young educated Kirkukis support the view that different ethnic groups should have an equal say. There is also broad support for an institutional arrangement–Kirkuk’s becoming an autonomous region–that may provide space for instituting “equal say”. And deliberating with balanced information broadens support for that arrangement. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Modern clientelist exchange is typically carried out by intermediaries-party activists, employers, local strongmen, traditional leaders, and the like. Politicians use such brokers to mobilize voters, yet little about their relative effectiveness is known. The authors argue that broker effectiveness depends on their leverage over clients and their ability to monitor voters. They apply their theoretical framework to compare two of the most common brokers worldwide, party activists and employers, arguing the latter enjoy numerous advantages along both dimensions. Using survey-based framing experiments in Venezuela and Russia, the authors find voters respond more strongly to turnout appeals from employers than from party activists. To demonstrate mechanisms, the article shows that vulnerability to job loss and embeddedness in workplace social networks make voters more responsive to clientelist mobilization by their bosses. The results shed light on the conditions most conducive to effective clientelism and highlight broker type as important for understanding why clientelism is prevalent in some countries but not others. © 2019 Trustees of Princeton University.},

abstract={Traditional leadership often coexists with modern political institutions; yet, we know little about how traditional and state authority cues—or those from male or female sources—affect public opinion. Using an original survey experiment of 1,381 Malawians embedded in the 2016 Local Governance Performance Index (LGPI), we randomly assign respondents into one of four treatment groups or a control group to hear messages about a child marriage reform from a female or male traditional authority (TA) or parliamentarian. In the sample as a whole, the female TA is as effective as the control (i.e., no endorsement), while other messengers elicit lower support (i.e., backfire effects). Endorsements produce heterogeneous effects across respondent sex and patrilineal/matrilineal customs, suggesting the need for tailored programs. Our paper adds an intersectional approach to the governance literature and offers a theoretical framework capable of explaining the impact of state and traditional endorsements across policy domains. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={This study examines public support for a key contested multicultural policy in contemporary Europe: the provision of religious schools. It makes two main contributions, one substantive and one theoretical. Substantively, the main contribution is to provide new experimental evidence demonstrating the existence of discrimination against Muslims on a central issue of multicultural social policy. Theoretically, the main contribution is to propose an explanation for variations in patterns of discrimination that highlights the role of individuals’ motivation to control prejudice. Through moderation analysis, we show that individuals who express stronger motivation to control prejudice are more likely to treat Muslim and Christian requests for religious schools equally, and they are more likely to retain their support for Muslim schools in the wake of a threatening Islamist terrorist incident. Because we conducted the experiments in three countries, we in addition find societal-level patterns of variation: Individuals’ motivation to control prejudice is more strongly associated with nondiscriminatory responses to the question of religious schools where a more multicultural path of accommodation has been pursued. This societal-level variation raises new hypotheses about how multicultural policies may interact with public opinion and underlines the importance of comparative experimental work. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Do economic sanctions turn the public against the target government or cause it to rally around the flag? How do sanctions affect attitudes toward the sanctioner? How does bad economic performance under sanctions shape support for the target government? Despite their importance, these questions have rarely been explored with survey data. Results from two surveys in Russia find that exposure to information about economic sanctions does not generate a rally around the flag, leads some groups to withdraw support from the target government, and reduces support for the sanctioner. Respondents also react more strongly to the reasons why sanctions were put in place—the annexation of Crimea—than to the sanctions themselves. These results suggest the need to reevaluate theories of the impact of economic sanctions and blame-shifting under autocracy. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Welfare state reform in times of austerity is notoriously difficult because most citizens oppose retrenchment of social benefits. Governments, thus, tend to combine cutbacks with selective benefit expansions, thereby creating trade-offs: to secure new advantages, citizens must accept painful cutbacks. Prior research has been unable to assess the effectiveness of compensating components in restrictive welfare reforms. We provide novel evidence on feasible reform strategies by applying conjoint survey analysis to a highly realistic direct democratic setting of multidimensional welfare state reform. Drawing on an original survey of Swiss citizens’ attitudes toward comprehensive pension reform, we empirically demonstrate that built-in trade-offs strongly enhance the prospects of restrictive welfare reforms. Our findings indicate that agency matters: governments and policy makers can and must grant the right compensations to the relevant opposition groups to overcome institutional inertia. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={This study suggests that in-group loyalty, defined as the degree to which people favor their own group over others, undermines the punishment of corruption. We present evidence from two studies. First, we utilize a real-world corruption scandal involving the ruling party in Spain that broke during survey fieldwork. People exposed to the scandal withhold support from the incumbent, but in-group loyalty based on partisanship weakens this effect. Second, we explore in-group loyalty beyond partisanship through laboratory experiments. These experiments artificially induce group identities, randomly assign the group identity of candidates and shut down any instrumental benefits of in-group loyalty. The experimental evidence suggests that people support corrupt candidates as long as they share a group identity and are willing to sacrifice material payoffs to do so. Our findings have important implications. Most importantly perhaps, they suggest that candidates can get away with corruption by engaging in identity politics. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Scholars have long claimed that political movements founded by charismatic leaders must undergo “routinization,” or depersonalization, to survive. Yet many such movements appear to have sustained their charismatic nature and have persisted or reemerged in cases as diverse as Argentina, Venezuela, Peru, Turkey, and China. Focusing on Argentine Peronism and Venezuelan Chavismo, this article examines the potential of new leaders to revive their charismatic predecessors’ legacies to perpetuate the movement and gain the followers’ support. Through face-to-face survey experiments conducted in both countries, the article shows that new leaders who (a) implement bold, initially impressive policies and (b) symbolically tie themselves to the charismatic founder cause citizens to express stronger emotional attachments to the movement and garner political support. The results challenge the notion that charismatic movements are short-lived and underscore the potential of these movements to impact democratic politics and party-system development long after their founders disappear. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Governments with strict control over the information that their citizens hear from foreign sources are regular targets of human rights pressure, but we know little about how this information matters in the domestic realm. I argue that authoritarian regimes strategically pass on certain types of external pressure to their public to “internationalize” human rights violations, making citizens view human rights in terms of defending their nation internationally rather than in terms of individual violations, and making them more likely to be satisfied with their government’s behavior. I find strong support for this model through statistical analysis of Chinese state media reports of external human rights pressure and a survey experiment on Chinese citizens’ responses to pressure on women’s rights. This analysis demonstrates that authoritarian regimes may be able to manipulate international human rights diplomacy to help them retain the support of their population while suppressing their human rights. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Do experts rationalize and legitimize authoritarian governance? Although research on expert actors in contexts of democracy and international governance is now extensive, scholarly work on their role in authoritarian settings remains limited. This article helps open the black box of authoritarian decision-making by investigating expert advisers in the Arab Gulf monarchies, where ruling elites have enlisted them from top universities and global consulting firms. Qualitative fieldwork combined with three experiments casts doubt on both the rationalization and legitimacy hypotheses and also generates new insights surrounding unintended consequences. On rationalization, the evidence suggests that experts contribute to perverse cycles of overconfidence among authoritarian ruling elites, thereby enabling a belief in state-building shortcuts. On legitimacy, the experiments demonstrate a backfire effect, with experts reducing public support for reform. The author makes theoretical contributions by suggesting important and heretofore unrecognized conflicts and trade-offs across experts' potential for rationalizing vis-à-vis legitimizing0.

abstract={Why do people assume female politicians are less likely than men to engage in the illegal use of public positions for private gain? We argue that voters may perceive women as marginalized within political institutions, or as more risk averse and consequently more constrained by institutional oversight, which could lead to perceptions of women as less likely to engage in corruption. Using an original survey experiment, we test these mechanisms against conventional wisdom that women are seen as more honest. We find strong support for the risk aversion explanation, as well as heterogeneous effects by respondent sex for both the marginalization and honesty mechanisms. These findings suggest that the institutional contexts in which women are operating can help explain why people perceive them as less likely to engage in corruption. Identifying these mechanisms is critical to understanding the role of women in politics and for improving trust in government. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={How do economic sanctions affect the political attitudes of individuals in targeted countries? Do they reduce or increase support for policy change? Are targeted, “smart” sanctions more effective in generating public support? Despite the importance of these questions for understanding the effectiveness of sanctions, they have received little systematic attention. We address them drawing on original data from Israel, where the threat of economic sanctions has sparked a contentious policy debate. We first examine the political effects of the European Union’s (EU) 2015 decision to label goods produced in the West Bank, and then expand our analysis by employing a survey experiment that allows us to test the differential impact of sanction type and sender identity. We find that the EU’s decision produced a backlash effect, increasing support for hardline policies and raising hostility toward Europe. Our findings further reveal that individuals are likely to support concessions only in the most extreme and unlikely of circumstances—a comprehensive boycott imposed by a sender perceived as a key strategic ally. These results offer theoretical and policy implications for the study of the effects of economic sanctions. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Relative distribution—whether one is favored or disfavored by government—seems to matter to voters in many African countries. But why? I demonstrate theoretically that voters who do not have information about government revenues, and who cannot determine whether their allocation represents an absolutely high share, can compare their goods with others’ to generate a rough prediction of whether they would be better off under a challenger. In this model, relative distribution is a heuristic, whose relevance is conditioned by available information. I test the model among a sample of Ugandan lab participants, who, when not told how much a “leader” had to distribute, were significantly more likely to reelect the leader when their payout was greater than another player’s. Those given information about the size of the pot, however, no longer responded to relative distribution. I show external validity by demonstrating that the incumbent’s ethnicity, which strongly predicts whom he favors, is less important to respondents on the cross-national Afrobarometer when they report easy access to information on government revenues; other types of information do not show a similar effect. Unfortunately, though rational under low information, voting on relative distribution is not optimal under all conditions: Those who are favored by a highly corrupt leader are most likely to reelect him when they are relying on relative distribution to make their choice. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={We examine how descriptive representation, formal representation, and responsiveness affect the legitimacy of political decisions: Who are the representatives, how are they selected, what is the outcome of the decision-making process, and to what extent do these three aspects matter for decision acceptance among the citizens? We examine this from the citizens’ perspective, and ask whether decisions are perceived as more legitimate when they are made by groups that reflect society in certain characteristics and chosen according to certain selection procedures. In a Norwegian survey experiment, we find that people are more willing to accept a decision when it is made by a group of people like them, and who are assigned as decision makers based on their expertise. Descriptive representation also serves as a cushion for unfavorable decisions. Moreover, when asked, the traditionally less advantaged groups tend to value descriptive representation more than other citizens. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Bureaucratic behavior in developing countries remains poorly understood. Why do some public servants—yet not others—work hard to deliver public services, misuse state resources, and/or participate in electoral mobilization? A classic answer comes from Weber: Bureaucratic structures shift behavior toward integrity, neutrality, and commitment to public service. Our study conducts the first survey experimental test of the effects of bureaucratic structures. It does so through a conjoint experiment with public servants in the Dominican Republic. Looking at merit examinations and job stability, we find that Weber was right—but only partially. Recruitment by examination curbs corruption and political services by bureaucrats, while enhancing work motivation. Job stability, by contrast, only decreases political services: Tenured bureaucrats are less likely to participate in electoral mobilization. Examinations thus enhance the quality of bureaucracy (motivation and lower corruption) and democracy (electoral competition); job stability only enhances the quality of democracy. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={How do incumbents prevent the opposition from claiming credit for government programs? The received scholarly wisdom is that central government authorities favor copartisans in lower tiers of government to reward allies and punish opponents. Yet this depiction ignores the range of strategies available to incumbents at the center. I argue that another effective strategy is to channel resources through nonstate organizations, thus bypassing the opposition and reducing “credit hijacking.” Using a regression-discontinuity design with data from Brazil, I show that mayors from the president’s party receive more resources, but that the election of an opposition mayor induces the central government to shift resources to nonstate organizations that operate in the locality. Original survey data, fieldwork, and data on organizations’ leaders support the claim that opposition mayors do not hijack credit from government spending through nonstate organizations. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={The relation between religious organizations and political authority is notoriously tense. Max Weber argued that this is because both compete over the same resource: human commitment. This article revisits Weber’s hypothesis. Specifically, we explore two psychological mechanisms through which Protestant missionaries affect political authority: obedience and persuadability. Exploiting exogenous variation in missionary activity in Peru, we demonstrate that missionaries make converts more obedient, which we attribute to a theological and a social mechanism. Yet, we also find that missionaries make converts less susceptible to persuasion by political authorities because they shift attention from secular topics to questions of theological importance, and endorse a skeptical stance toward the government. Exploiting variation in treatment intensity, we argue that the degree to which political authority is affected depends on a given mission’s theological strictness. We arrive at these findings by combining experimental outcomes and process-tracing evidence using Bayesian integration. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={This article examines how parties use clientelism in competitive and uncompetitive electoral environments. It argues that parties enjoy wide discretion to target clientelistic payoffs to inexpensive voters in their strongholds, but that head-to-head competition compels them to bid for more expensive voters. Empirically, it uses a list experiment embedded in a postelection survey to study electoral clientelism in Lebanon, a country with a mix of competitive and uncompetitive electoral districts. It finds respondents underreport clientelistic transactions by a factor of two. Proxies for the cost of a vote explain payoff targeting decisions in party strongholds, but lose their explanatory power in the competitive districts. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={The dominant perspective on federalism and American public opinion suggests that Americans simply do not consider federalism when making policy evaluations. Recently, however, several scholars have argued that even if Americans do not make legalistic or theoretical references to federalism, they often think intuitively about intergovernmental politics. This study presents the results of a three-part survey experiment designed to assess how readily individuals come to think about federalism when evaluating public policy. In general, individuals do not consider the intergovernmental implications of policy, even when asked to explicitly compare two levels of government. Overwhelmingly, individual preference for government activity obscures concerns for federalism in eight of nine substantive policy domains. Yet, this indeterminacy does not mean that public opinion is irrelevant for studies of American federalism. Rather, it is a highly malleable instrument that political elites can use to leverage public support for policies. © The Author 2017.

abstract={Between the 1980s and 2006 Nicaragua was a competitive democracy where parties of the left and right won national presidential elections and relinquished power when their terms ended. More recently the quality of Nicaragua’s democracy has deteriorated. This change is due partly to autocratic behaviour by the elected leftist president, Daniel Ortega. But democratic decline is also the result of factional divisions and vague, outmoded policy commitments on the right that have crippled its electoral competitiveness, enabling Ortega’s behaviour. Utilizing an experimental research design, this article identifies two modernized policy platforms that could significantly broaden rightist electoral support in presidential campaigns, aiding democratic resurgence in Nicaragua. At a point when opposition parties are struggling to retain strength and coherence in many other democracies, the study presents a research strategy that could help clarify the ways such parties might reinvigorate their electoral competitiveness. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The implications of clientelism for democratic accountability are mixed: Brokers not only help coordinate votes for collective gain but also exploit their position to advance personal interest. I argue that brokers use distinct strategies—persuasion, reciprocation, and punishment—to motivate voters as a function of their local institutional context. Competitively selected brokers whose preferences are aligned with those of followers can rely more on persuasion than instrumental inducements. Economically autonomous brokers are more likely to rely on sanctions than reciprocity. Evidence to support both the proposed typology of broker strategies and their determinants is collected in Senegal, a clientelistic democracy where group-level heterogeneity generates natural variation in broker types. A coordination game played with real brokers illustrates that participants are less likely to sacrifice personal gain when brokers are competitively selected, more likely when they most fear retribution. Qualitative data suggest that results from the laboratory game plausibly generalize to behavior in elections. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={How do citizens in weak democracies evaluate claims on government assistance made by other ethnic groups? This paper analyzes data from an original survey experiment in the Republic of Georgia to determine the role of ethnic cues in the formation of redistributive preferences. In the experiment, ethnic Georgian subjects are randomly assigned a mock news article with variation on implied ethnic (Georgian, Azeri, or Armenian) identity and type of redistributive demand, and asked to evaluate the demand. The results show modest but consistent evidence of ethnic bias conditional on both types of variation, along with ethnic stereotypes, even while subjects are highly pro-redistribution in general. This study highlights how subtle biases can shape redistributive policy preferences in ways inimical to democracy in multiethnic societies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Poor public service provision and government accountability is commonplace in low-income countries. Although mobile phone–based platforms have emerged to allow constituents to report service deficiencies to government officials, they have been plagued by low citizen participation. We question whether low participation may root in low political efficacy to politically participate. In the context of a text message–reporting platform in Uganda, we investigate the impact of adding efficacy-boosting language to mobilization texts—(a) citizen name personalization and (b) politician encouragement—on citizens’ willingness to report service deficiencies to politicians via text messages. Both treatments, designed to increase internal and external efficacy, respectively, have a large, positive effect on participation. The results are driven by traditionally less internally efficacious constituents (females) and less externally efficacious constituents (those represented by opposition party members), respectively. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Can politicians facilitate citizen acceptance of unwelcome policy decisions by acting responsively during the decision-making process? We suggest a framework to analyze the responsiveness–acceptance connection and report findings from two studies designed for that purpose. First, we ran a survey experiment to examine how exogenously induced responsiveness actions affect reactions to a policy decision. Second, we conducted a case study to see how results hold up in a real-world setting. We find that responsiveness actions are rewarded provided that citizens are convinced that politicians have paid attention to their wishes and views. Responsiveness actions that signal willingness to communicate (“to listen” and “to explain”) are more effective than the action to follow majority opinion (“to adapt”). However, the responsiveness–acceptance connection is sensitive to perceptual bias; policy losers are hard pressed to accept that politicians have indeed acted responsively. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

Citizen participation channels are designed to improve policymaking and increase feelings of regime responsiveness, but how successful are these limited reforms in stemming pressure for broader change?

abstract={Political systems dominated by a single party are common in the developing world, including in countries that hold regular elections. Yet we lack knowledge about the strategies by which these regimes maintain political dominance. This article presents evidence from Tanzania, a paradigmatic dominant party regime, to demonstrate how party institutions are used instrumentally to ensure the regime's sustained control. First, I show that the ruling party maintains a large infrastructure of neighbourhood representatives, and that in the presence of these agents, citizens self-censor about their political views. Second, I provide estimates of the frequency with which politicians give goods to voters around elections, demonstrating that such gifts are more common in Tanzania than previous surveys suggest. Third, I use a survey experiment to test respondents’ reaction to information about corruption. Few voters change their preferences upon receipt of this information. Taken together, this article provides a detailed picture of ruling party activities at the micro-level in Tanzania. Citizens conceal opposition sympathies from ten cell leaders, either because they fear punishment or seek benefits. These party agents can monitor citizens’ political views, facilitating clientelist exchange. Finally, citizens’ relative insensitivity to clientelism helps explain why politicians are not punished for these strategies. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This article assesses the apparent effect of political multiculturalism on tolerance of Muslim accommodation among native-born majority members. Our principle goal is in understanding how public opinion on religious accommodation varies as a function of both federal multicultural policy, on one hand, and more deeply rooted notions of political culture, on the other. We do so by examining responses to a pair of survey experiments embedded in surveys conducted in Canada and the United States. The experiments allow us to convincingly demonstrate “Muslim exceptionalism.” Contextual comparisons across multicultural policy regimes (Canada and the United States) and within them but across distinct political cultures (Quebec vs. English Canada) lend credence to a fairly subdued role for policy and a much larger one for political culture. These effects are, we argue and show, strongly moderated by support for multiculturalism at the individual-level. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={The politics of economic crises brings distributive economic conflict to the fore of national political debates. How policy should be used to transfer resources between citizens becomes a central political question, and the answers chosen often influence the trajectory of policy for a generation. This context provides an ideal setting for evaluating the importance of self-interest and other-regarding preferences in shaping public opinion about economic policy. This article investigates whether self-centered inequity aversion along with self-interest influences individual tax policy opinions. We conduct original survey experiments in France and the United States, and provide evidence that individuals care about both how policy alternatives affect their own interests and how they influence the welfare of others relative to themselves. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Do public images of state leaders affect individuals’ political attitudes and behaviors? If so, why do they have that effect and among whom? Authoritarian iconography could increase compliance with and support for the state via three causal mechanisms: legitimacy, self-interest, and coercion. This article uses a laboratory experiment in the United Arab Emirates to evaluate the effect of public images of state leaders on individuals’ compliance with and support for an authoritarian regime. Using a pre-registered research design, it finds no meaningful evidence that authoritarian iconography increases political compliance or support for the Emirati regime. Although these null results may be due to a number of factors, the findings have important implications for the future research agenda on how and why authoritarian leaders use political culture to maintain power. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={The EU is facing unprecedented challenges and significant threats to its economic and political security. Austerity, the Eurozone crisis, rising immigration and heightened fear of terrorism all present serious challenges to the process of integration. How does this context of insecurity impact on what the EU means to its citizens? Will the public become increasingly Eurosceptic or will they discover a hitherto unrecognised attachment to the EU as the prospect of its collapse becomes real? Psychological research has demonstrated that individual exposure to threat decreases cognitive capacity, inducing a tendency towards rigidity or conservatism-a tendency to cling to the â devil you know'. So what might this mean for the European integration process? Using experimental techniques drawn from political psychology, the authors find a dual threat effect. The EU symbol has a negative (anti-EU) effect on EU-related attitudes when presented in neutral context. This is consonant with conceptualisations of the EU as a threat to national cultural and political norms. In contrast, however, visual priming of participants with EU symbols has a positive (pro-EU) effect on related attitudes when symbols are presented in a context that implies a subtle but imminent threat to the benefits of EU membership. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={In this article, we use an experimental survey design to explore how the tactical choices of social movements affect public opinion about whether the government should negotiate with the movement and the bargains that should be struck once negotiations begin. In doing so, we test competing theories about how we should expect the use of tactics with varying degrees of extremeness—including demonstrations, occupations, and bombings—to influence public opinion. We find that respondents are less likely to think the government should negotiate with organizations that use the tactic of bombing when compared with demonstrations or occupations. However, depending on the outcome variable and baseline category used in the analysis, we find mixed support for whether respondents think organizations that use bombings should receive less once negotiations begin. The results of this article are generally consistent with the theoretical and policy-based arguments centering around how governments should not negotiate with organizations that engage in violent activity commonly associated with terrorist organizations. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={A growing body of scholarship on the political and economic subordination of women in the Muslim world has argued that widespread patriarchal attitudes toward women’s roles in public life can be ameliorated by offering progressive reinterpretations of Islamic scriptures. In this article, we explore this hypothesis with a large-scale survey experiment conducted among adult Egyptians in late 2013. In the study, a subset of respondents were exposed to an argument in favor of women’s political equality that was grounded in the Qur’ān, Islam’s holiest text. We found that this group was significantly more willing to express approval of female political leadership than those exposed to a non-religious argument in favor of women’s eligibility for political leadership. A further analysis of conditional treatment effects suggests that the religious justification for female political leadership was more likely to elicit agreement among less educated and less pious respondents, and when delivered by women and targeted at men. Our findings suggest that Islamic discourse, so often used to justify the political exclusion of women, can also be used to help empower them. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Though caste remains a major social cleavage and a source of social exclusion in India, three factors now rise against it: a diversifying middle class, urbanization, and a demographic youth bulge. While conventional wisdom suggests that Indians marry within their own caste, we find that in the urban, middle-class marriage market, which increasingly includes members of lower castes, openness to intercaste marriage is substantial and varies within and across groups. Why are some more open to intercaste marriage? Drawing on a semi-experimental study of 1070 marriage market participants belonging to both Scheduled and upper castes, we argue that interest in intercaste marriage is rooted in a desire for upward mobility and governed by the principle of exchange. Those who can benefit from an exchange and who have high class or caste status to offer are more likely to express an interest in intermarriage. Among Scheduled Caste individuals, interest in intermarriage increases with income, while among upper caste individuals the opposite is true. We also find that the Scheduled Caste groups in our study are more interested in intermarriage than the upper caste ones. Increasing openness to intermarriage – particularly when upper castes are willing to marry lower (backward and Scheduled) castes – is a sign of social inclusion in urban India. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Political decentralization is often argued to strengthen political accountability by bringing government closer to the people. Social and civic institutions at the local level, such as lineage associations, temples, churches, or social clubs, can make it easier for citizens to monitor officials and hold them accountable. This article argues that strong social institutions also empower local elites who may use their informal influence to control their group and capture rents. Drawing on evidence from case studies of Chinese villages, the article shows that lineage group leaders who become village officials use their combination of social and political authority to confiscate villagers' land. Evidence from a survey experiment suggests that endorsement of a land confiscation plan by lineage elites elicits greater compliance with property seizures. A national survey indicates that when a lineage leader becomes a village cadre, it is associated with a 14 to 20 percent increase in the likelihood of a land expropriation. The findings demonstrate how informal institutions and local civil society can be tools of top-down political control. Copyright © Trustees of Princeton University 2016.},

abstract={Why is vote buying effective even where ballot secrecy is protected? Most answers emerge from models of machine politics, in which a machine holds recipients of handouts accountable for their subsequent political behavior. Yet vote buying is common in many contexts where political party machines are not present, or where parties exert little effort in monitoring voters. This article addresses this puzzle. The author argues that politicians often distribute electoral handouts to convey information to voters. This vote buying conveys information with respect to the future provision of resources to the poor. The author tests the argument with original qualitative and experimental data collected in Kenya. A voter's information about a candidate's vote buying leads to substantial increases in electoral support, an effect driven by expectations about the provision of clientelist benefits beyond the electoral period. The results, showing that the distribution of material benefits can be electorally effective for persuasive reasons, thereby explain how vote buying can be effective in the absence of machine politics.

abstract={In democratic Africa, where ethnicity is a key driver of vote choice, politicians must attract voters across ethnic lines. This article explores one way politicians can do this: by appealing to a coethnic bond through their spouse. We propose that cross-ethnic spouses can help candidates send credible signals of coalition building before an election. We test this argument with a survey experiment in Benin, where President Yayi has married across ethnic lines. Our results confirm that priming the first lady’s ethnicity increases support for President Yayi among her coethnics. We generalize these results by combining new data on leader-spouse ethnicity with Afrobarometer survey data. Our results suggest that cross-ethnic marriages are one tool leaders can use to shore up support in multiethnic elections. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Much of the recent scholarship about ethnicity in comparative politics has focused on why ethnicity becomes a salient cleavage. Yet opinions still diverge as to how ethnicity matters. This article tests three hypotheses relevant to this question. Building on recent arguments, it first hypothesizes that voters take the ethnicity of parties and candidates into consideration. Second, it hypothesizes that wherever ethnicity is politically salient, it matters beyond coethnicity—that is, voters’ decisions are guided by ethnicity even when they are choosing among non-coethnics. Third, it argues that the advantage conferred by ethnicity is mediated by non-ethnic factors. A large vignette experiment carried in 2013 in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh provides strong support for each of these hypotheses. These results imply that the influence of ethnicity on voting behavior may be subtler and more complex than what the main theories of ethnic politics usually assume. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={There are numerous studies of the effects of partisan cues in established party systems, but almost none on how they affect voting in new party systems. This lacuna might stem from untested assumptions that partisan cues are un-influential where parties lack multigenerational psychological bonds with citizens and long-standing records. Alternatively, we theorize that even in new party systems, voters use partisan cues to assess candidates’ capabilities, preferences, and electoral viability. We test this theory through an experiment in which we varied inclusion of party identifiers on mock ballots in Uganda, where the multiparty system was only 5 years old. We find that partisan cues increased selection of major-party candidates over independents, casting of straight-ticket ballots, and votes for copartisans. Our results challenge the common assumption that partisan labels are irrelevant in new party systems. Partisan cues can influence political decision making, even when party systems are young. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={What determines the attitude of citizens toward international trade in advanced industrialized nations? The question raises an intriguing paradox for low-income citizens in developed economies. Increasing imports pose the most severe threat to job security for low-income citizens, who, on the other hand, reap the greatest benefits from cheaper imports as consumers. This article considers the role of dual identities that citizens have as both income-earners and consumers, and investigates how attitudes toward trade differ depending on which aspect of respondents’ lives—that is, work versus consumption—is activated. The results of an originally designed survey experiment conducted in Japan during the recession suggest that the activation of a consumer perspective is associated with much higher support for free trade. In particular, those respondents who have lower levels of job security are the ones who, with consumer-priming, increase their support for foreign imports. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={What explains individual support for inter-regional redistribution? Few studies examine support for regional redistribution, even though such issues are politically salient in many democracies. We test models that hypothesize that such preferences are affected by regional and individual income, as well as other arguments beyond the traditional political economy framework. We focus on informational assumptions and implications of these models with an experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey in Spain. We randomly inform some citizens of the true relative income of their region to assess the impact of this information on regional redistribution preferences. We find that citizens’ learning about their region’s relative position affects these preferences in a manner consistent with some of the political economy models. We also find some support for out-group concerns as an important factor. The findings have implications for the applicability of economic models to explaining support for regional arrangements. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={Although elections have become the norm not only in democratic regimes but also in autocratic ones, the legitimacy of the electoral process in different countries is often contested. Facing strong international pressures to prove democratic credentials, eventual winners have a strong incentive to ensure high levels of voter turnout. Conversely, leaders of parties likely to lose the election have an incentive to reduce turnout—for example, through boycotts—to delegitimize the election. In such situations, turnout is a major dimension of competition. To overcome the potential delegitimizing effects of low turnout, incumbents will often turn toward clientelistic mobilization, as high turnout can be a powerful rejoinder to those who denounce elections as a sham and can put observers’ concerns about the legitimacy of the electoral process to rest. We develop a theory to explain how such campaigns will target particularistic benefits. We argue that what we term “legitimacy buying” will be primarily aimed at “staunching the bleeding” of supporters who are usually consistent voters but have doubts about the legitimacy of the election. This theoretical prediction departs from theories used to explain vote buying in contexts in which the legitimacy of the elections is largely uncontested by significant groups in society. The theory is supported by data from a list experiment on vote buying conducted after the Honduran 2009 elections, which occurred in the wake of President Zelaya’s ousting and in the midst of a boycott promoted by his supporters. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={The strong support that African presidents retain among voters of their own ethnicity, despite clear evidence of shirking and corruption, has prompted numerous empirical investigations into whether an incumbent's ethnicity or performance is more important to African voters. The model of vote choice underlying almost all of these studies is additive and implies that either coethnicity or good performance can increase a candidate's vote share. However, there is little theoretical justification for such a model. In the dominant theory of ethnic voting in Africa, coethnicity is a signal of better outcomes, indicating that ethnicity and performance are not separate considerations. Using an experiment that is designed to determine how Ugandan voters make choices, the author shows that the effects of coethnicity and good performance interact: neither attribute increases support for a candidate in the absence of the other. Though previous analyses indicate that, all else being equal, voters always prefer coethnics, this study demonstrates that coethnics only have an advantage when they are not shirkers. Additionally, though previous studies indicate that voters always prefer good performers, this analysis shows that voters are indifferent to the performance of non-coethnic candidates. The article provides evidence that this pattern is in fact a result of voters' beliefs that they will only receive future goods from coethnics, making a demonstrated ability to provide such goods relevant for the electability of coethnic candidates, but not for non-coethnics. Since a large number of African voters do not share the ethnicity of their incumbent, this finding has troubling implications for accountability of African leaders.

abstract={Do affirmative action measures for women in politics change the way constituents view and interact with their female representatives? A subnational randomized policy experiment in Lesotho with single-member districts reserved for female community councilors provides causal evidence to this question. Using survey data, I find that having a quota-mandated female representative either has no effect on or actually reduces several dimensions of women’s self-reported engagement with local politics. In addition, implications from the policy experiment suggest that the quota effect is not accounted for by differences in qualifications or competence between the different groups of councilors, but rather stems from citizens’ negative reactions to the quota’s design. © The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={At the psychological level, ethnic conflict can be seen as an extreme result of normal group identification processes. Bridging perceived intergroup boundaries is therefore key to improving intergroup relations. In contrast to the dominant association of nationalism with racism, chauvinism, xenophobia, and intolerance, we highlight the constructive potential of national identification. In a survey experiment, we find that the increased salience of a shared (Indian) national identity increases donations by members of a dominant ethnic group (Hindus) to members of a rival, minority group (Muslims). This effect is moderated by social status (caste). We suggest that national identification leads to a greater transformation in the behavior of low-status members of an ethnic group because they are more likely to be drawn to national identity as an enhancement of their social standing. Our study has implications for theories of social identity and interethnic cooperation, as well as for the literature on nationalism. © The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={Recent research on clientelism focuses on mercenary exchanges between voters and brokers. In this "instrumentalist" view, machine politics is only sustainable where patrons can punish clients for defection-a situation that does not apply in many places known for clientelism. We build a different theory of clientelism around the norm of reciprocity. If exchanges rely on clients' feelings of obligation to return favors to their patrons, then clientelism can be sustained even where the ballot is genuinely secret. To support this argument, we draw on a range of research, including a series of split-sample experiments embedded in two surveys on Mexico specifically focused on reciprocity. Our findings have implications for voting behavior, party organization, and the types of public policies that may prevent clientelism.},

abstract={This article studies how voters react when foreign powers support a particular political party in a fragile democracy. The article identifies which voters believe the intervention plays a positive role in the electoral process and which voters have the opposite opinion. The article argues that educated and politically sophisticated voters will reject such interventions because of the negative role those play in the democratization process. Specific hypotheses are developed based on this argument and were tested in a randomized framing experiment embedded in a post-election survey of 2500 voters in Lebanon 2009. The survey results confirm the argument above. Furthermore, this study derives implications for the risks and benefits of 'guiding' democratic outcomes from abroad. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This article considers how partisanship conditions attitudes toward corruption. Stirred by the puzzle of why corruption does not seem to have the electoral consequences we would expect, it explores whether party supporters are more tolerant toward corruption cases when they affect their own party. The partisan-bias hypothesis is confirmed by a survey experiment carried out in Spain, a country where a number of corruption scandals have been recently visible. The results show that the same offense is judged differently depending on whether the responsible politician is a member of the respondent's party, of unknown partisan affiliation, or of a rival party. Furthermore, the degree of partisan bias depends on political sophistication. This suggests that although partisanship may induce tolerance to same-party corruption practices, the partisan bias disappears when political awareness is high. © The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={Political parties not only aggregate the policy preferences of their supporters, but also have the ability to shape those preferences. Experimental evidence demonstrates that, when parties stake out positions on policy issues, partisans become more likely to adopt these positions, whether out of blind loyalty or because they infer that party endorsements signal options consistent with their interests or values. It is equally clear, however, that partisans do not always follow their party's lead. The authors investigate the impact of three party-level traits on partisan cue taking: longevity, incumbency, and ideological clarity. As parties age, voters may become more certain of both the party's reputation and their own allegiance. Governing parties must take action and respond to events, increasing the likelihood of compromise and failure, and therefore may dilute their reputation and disappoint followers. Incumbency aside, some parties exhibit greater ambiguity in their ideological position than other parties, undermining voter certainty about the meaning of cues. The authors test these hypotheses with experiments conducted in three multiparty democracies (Poland, Hungary, and Great Britain). They find that partisans more strongly follow their party's lead when that party is older, in the opposition, or has developed a more consistent ideological image. However, the impact of longevity vanishes when the other factors are taken into account. Underscoring the importance of voter (un)certainty, ideologically coherent opposition parties have the greatest capacity to shape the policy views of followers. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={The dominant theoretical approaches in the comparative political economy of the welfare state provide alternative accounts for why some governments spend more on social policies than others. In the first, poor voters seek to increase their current income by taxing the rich, and social policy serves to redistribute income from the rich to the poor. In the second account, voters seek social insurance against future job loss, and social policy serves as an insurance mechanism rather than a redistributive one. Both of these accounts share the assumption that voters can clearly distinguish between the redistributive and insurance elements of public policy and, therefore, that individual-level characteristics (income, labor market risks) systematically shape preferences over social policy. Our goal is to examine the soundness of that behavioral assumption. We do so with a laboratory experiment that involves economic production, voting on taxation and fiscal transfers. We treat subjects with social policies that vary in their level of redistribution and insurance to examine how this impacts their preferred tax rate. We complement the experimental evidence with data from original survey questions that assess voters' knowledge of the distributive characteristics of different social policies in the U.S. Evidence from both settings suggest only marginal support for behavioral underpinnings of the standard insurance model, particularly as the empirical setting more closely approximates the real world. © The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={With their "deeply divided societies", distinctive electoral rules and pivotal religious parties, Israeli and Turkish politics offer crucial cases to probe into "polarization" processes and the ways in which religious parties play a role in them. Using a large sample of public opinion and experimental survey data, the analysis shows how polarization can be marked by some contravening trends. Despite declining social trust, religious party supporters do not denounce any institutions categorically; yet disregard some opposing parties as viable political alternatives. The political positions of religious partisans differ from their party leadership. Supporters assign different levels of significance to polarizing issues and carry the potential of forming issue-based coalitions across different ideological groups. Although they acquire news and political information from different venues, most partisans tend to process factual information through partisan lenses, reinforcing partisan ideological commitments. While religious party supporters increasingly reject the existing markers of politics and show signs of political apathy, they do not withdraw from politics. With their multifaceted commitments, religious party supporters do not fall into mutually exclusive political groups. Given the tendency of the political elite to exacerbate divisions for political expediency, it is ultimately the ability of individuals to engage in politics beyond the confines of party politics that presents an escape from these polarization traps. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Economists have argued that outsourcing is another form of international trade. However, based on a representative national survey of Americans conducted in 2007 and 2009, the distribution of preferences on these two issues appears to be quite different. This article examines the origins of attitudes toward outsourcing, focusing on the extent to which it reflects (1) the economic vulnerabilities of individuals; (2) the information they receive about outsourcing, including their subjective understanding of what constitutes outsourcing; and (3) noneconomic attitudes toward foreign people and foreign countries. The findings emphasize the importance of variations in understandings of the term, as well as the highly symbolic nature of attitudes toward this issue. Individuals who believe the US should distance itself from international affairs more generally, who are nationalistic, or who feel that members of other ethnic and racial groups within the US are less praiseworthy than their own group tend to have particularly hostile reactions to outsourcing. The informational cues people receive are also important influences on their understanding of and attitudes toward outsourcing. Experimental results further emphasize the symbolic nature of attitudes toward outsourcing. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that attitudes are shaped less by the economic consequences of outsourcing than by a sense of us versus them. © Trustees of Princeton University 2013.},

abstract={Turkey's bid to join the European Union (EU) is more contentious than any previous enlargement of the EU. With the prospect of a predominantly Muslim country joining the Union, religious differences are often argued to be at the heart of public opposition to Turkish membership, whereas economic reasoning seems to dominate arguments in favour. Yet, public opinion on this issue is also highly volatile. This raises the question of the extent to which elite framing of the debate on Turkish accession can shape public opinion. Using a survey-embedded experimental study, we examine the differences in support between people exposed to - positive and negative - cultural and economic arguments. Our results show that the economic frames are persuasive across the board, whereas cultural (religious) frames are strongly conditioned by individual predispositions on religious diversity. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={Legitimacy theory suggests that judges are uniquely capable of increasing public support for government policies. However, this capacity may not be universal but conditional, depending on the institutional design of courts. In the United States, institutional differences between federal and state courts may make state judiciaries less capable of increasing public support for government policies. I investigate this possibility using an original survey experiment. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of three treatments, attributing the legalization of same-sex marriage to a state court, a governor, or a state legislature. I find, generally, that state courts are no more effective than other state institutions at building public support, but that this capacity of courts is variable, depending on levels of judicial independence. © 2011 The Author.},

abstract={An experimental survey on bureaucratic responsiveness in the social welfare arena in Poland and Russia shows that both countries' social welfare workers are capable of performing in a manner deemed helpful to local Polish and Russian citizens-a key component of effective governance. Such findings are surprising given an absence of reforms to create Weberian bureaucracies out of both countries' social welfare agencies, differences in Polish and Russian overall governance, and variations in civil society legacies. The findings suggest that Weberian features, designed to keep outside interests at bay, may not necessarily be essential for local government to be perceived as being responsive and may not be relevant for certain sectors, such as social welfare, where opportunities for corruption are more limited. Because "customer service" is important for an effective state, citizen perceptions of local bureaucrats' responsiveness need to be recognized as critical components of on-the-ground governance. © 2010 SAGE Publications.},
